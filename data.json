Some are brushy. Some are well maintained. They’re all worth checking out. However, this loop along the park’s narrow paved loop road is a classic. The road is open to automobiles (one-way, 10 mph speed limit) after 10:00 AM, but don’t let that discourage you. This is one of the most popular walking routes in the area and pedestrians outnumber other users.From the day-use parking area, walk north (counterclockwise), passing the park’s popular campground on the left and Sunset Beach on the right. Enjoy level walking to Green Point (elev. 30 ft/9 m), with its gorgeous San Juan Islands view, before starting to climb high bluffs above the crashing surf.At 0.8 mile (1.3 km), make a hairpin turn where a trail leads right to the tip of Fidalgo Head. At the third sharp turn, pass the trail to Juniper Point. After reaching an elevation of 250 feet (76 m), drop 80 feet (24 m), passing big cedars before climbing again. Pass a trail that leads right, dropping steeply to Burrows Pass. Then at 1.6 miles (2.6 km), reach one of the loop’s best overlooks (elev. 230 ft/70 m). On this juniper- and madrona-lined grassy open bluff, savor views to Mount Erie and across Burrows Pass to bulky Burrows Island. A short trail diverts right for more viewing.The road then descends, passing the Havekost Monument that honors the pioneer who, in 1911, donated the first parcel of what would become this beautiful park. Keep descending, passing through thick second-growth forest interspersed with big old stumps, closing the loop at 2.2 miles (3.5 km). Consider camping at the park and hiking this loop at sunset.","driving_directions":"From exit 230 on Interstate 5 in Burlington, follow State Route 20 west for 11.7 miles (18.8 km) to the junction with SR 20-Spur.

This five day, four night adventure begins at the 4,800 foot-high Billy Goat trailhead. The trail starts climbing at the start, reaching the treed Billy Goat Pass at 6,600 feet. Drop down the pass to an avalanche-scoured meadow complete with friendly marmots likely sunning themselves on gigantic boulders. Campsites dot the trail every so often, but your journey has just begun.In 2.2 miles you’ll reach a junction at 5,700 ft. Stay straight and continue walking steadily uphill toward the unique Three Fools Pass. This pass is among the most fascinating you may visit, the apex narrowly sitting in a slot between two ridges. In another 2.2 miles you’ll meet a junction with the Diamond Creek trail, stay on the Larch Creek trail and cross Diamond Creek. As you climb out of the creek bed, views will open up to the west and treat you to stately nearby peaks. Proceed another 2.5 miles to a nice campsite along Larch Creek or continue up to Larch Pass. A side trail at the pass takes you to lovely campsites surrounded by, you guessed it, larch trees. Two seasonal creeks flow nearby, but don't expect water later in the summer and fall.Day two takes you into the sublime high country! As Larch Pass is conquered the views open up. Soon you're climbing flower strewn McCall Gulch, approximately 4 miles from the previous night’s campsite or 2 miles from Larch Pass. At the top of McCall Gulch you’ll reach the 7,500 ft trail highpoint. Rest here, soaking in the views. Looking north you can see your route along the bottom of Sand Ridge. The next 3.7 miles provide you with babbling brooks, possible late-melting snow patches and finally scattered larch and fir trees at Peeve Pass. Make this area your home for the next two nights.Day three is the “choose you own adventure day” – there are many options from the area around Peeve Pass and they are all wonderful! Here are some ideas:• Hike the unmaintained trail to Ramon Lakes via Park Pass, nearly touching the Canadian border. Either hike back the way you came or for a more adventurous trip, finish the loop past the Sheep Lake trail. Note that the trail is faint in places as it crosses meadows, but the route-finding isn’t too difficult.• Swim in Quartz Lake contained in a cirque below Quartz Mountain.• Scramble up 8,274 ft Sheep Mountain – off trail experience needed. 360 degree views abound for miles upon miles.• Wander through pretty Whistler Basin via the unmaintained Sand Ridge trail.• Ramble along the top of Sand Ridge. You could even make a loop trip out of it by revisiting the 7,500-foot pass at the top of McCall Gulch. Note that being comfortable with rock scrambles is needed on this more rigorous route.On day four, wake up and wave goodbye to the Pasayten high country. Head back the way you came, spending night four at the same camp as night one. On day five, hike out and consider the trip a success!WTA Pro Tip: There are great dispersed camping options and campgrounds along Eightmile Creek road.

Since there is no sign that designates Deer Creek Falls trail, you will access it via the “Owyhigh Lakes Trail” which is marked on the right of southbound Highway 123, across the street from the parking area. Quickly cross the road (watch for traffic, it’s a busy road on a blind corner) to the marker and you will finally see the trailhead, which is mostly invisible from the road due to brush and low hanging tree branches. The trail immediately descends and disappears from the road into the forest valley. The descent is quick, but not too steep, about 280 feet over 0.4 miles. Wander down and around the couple of well-maintained switchback paths and marvel at the ancient and enormous Douglas fir trees, as well as the hemlock and cedar trees that thrive in the shadow of Mount Rainier. Pick up one of the curious 4-to-6 inch pine cones that litter the forest floor and look something like a fat mice.A quarter of a mile down is the first viewpoint of the falls. The falls are not huge, and the volume of water will vary depending on the time of year, but check out the cut of the boulders that make the water path appear to flow almost horizontally before pouring down to the next tier. The trail continues another quarter of a mile which will provide another falls vantage point where you can see it tumble into the Chinook creek. This section of the trail ends at the Eastside trail junction where there are a few simple walk-in only campsites and a pair of footbridges crossing over small but lively creeks that provide a place for rest, contemplation, or a least a few photo ops. If you want to keep hiking, you have some options of varying lengths. You can continue another 1.5 miles to investigate another waterfall on Kotsuck Creek. Owyhigh Lakes is another 2.5 miles beyond that (about five miles from the trailhead), and Sunrise Road is an even further destination (about 10 miles from the trailhead). Otherwise, you can turn around at the footbridge and head back up to your car to complete this lovely one mile roundtrip legstretcher.

If you feel like pressing on, Ollalie Lake is just about a mile and a half up trail, where open campsites offer lakeside havens with calm waters and views of a beautiful lake basin. From the Talapus parking area, head into dark, cool forest on a wide, if somewhat rooty trail. The grade is moderate, allowing you to enjoy the tall cedars and hemlocks all around you. The trail steepens soon, switchbacking up as Talapus Creek flows downhill to your right. While the trail is wide, watch where you step. Roots can be very slippery, especially when wet. Be on the lookout for a great photo opportunity at a sharp switchback about 1.3 miles in, where Talapus Creek foams into a ravine just off the trail. From this point the trail flattens out, heading straight through increasingly boggy terrain – be ready to get your boots wet! Just before crossing Talapus Creek, a fork greets hikers. Though the left path is still somewhat evident, branches and foliage lying across the trail indicate that this is not the way to go. Please don’t take this path. Your route to the lake is across the creek, over the footlog and through a bit more mud. WTA crews have worked here installing a turnpike, a structure that helps keep hikers’ feet out of the muddiest areas, just before the lake. Crest a small rise and shortly arrive at Talapus Lake. Break out a snack, or lunch if this is your final destination. If you’re pressing onto Ollalie Lake, stay on the trail at Talapus and switchback up the hillside through forest.  0.7 miles after leaving Talapus you’ll arrive at a junction. Crossing Talapus Creek via the right-hand path will put you on the Pratt Lake Trail after 0.2 miles, but Ollalie Lake is attained via the left-hand path. Hike a slightly steeper grade for about 0.3 miles. Shortly after climbing, the trail levels out and Ollalie Lake appears to your right. The trail stays high on the valley wall, but looking downhill you will see the campsites that dot the lake’s western shore. Head down to an unclaimed one and pitch camp, then relax in  the shade of the trees and splash in the lake. WTA Pro-Tip: The popularity of these lakes has made wildlife in this area particularly used to humans. Respect the principles of Leave No Trace by not feeding the gray jays (also known, appropriately, as camp robbers) and the chipmunks.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 45.

Immediately after this junction, a steady series of switchbacks propels hikers up through forest scarred by the Buck Creek Fire in 1905.  The rocky summit of Barlow Point is soon reached. This point housed a lookout tower from 1935 until 1964 when, ironically, it burned down.   Because the surrounding forest had burned in the 1905 fire, the Barlow Point fire lookout had unobstructed views in all directions.

In fact, the whole of the trip is on beautiful tread which allows you to spend more time looking  at the scenery around you and less time watching where your feet are going. And what scenery! Down low, the trees that provide you with welcome shade on your way up to the ridge crest are BIG! Though this area was left out of the 1984 Washington Wilderness Act, the trees surrounding you were spared the saw when President Bush signed Wild Sky Wilderness into law in 2008. So on your way up (and up, and up -- you'll gain 2,250 feet in 3.8 miles), stop to admire the ancient beauties that will now last as long as nature allows. Around two miles, the forest canopy begins to thin and huckleberry and mountain ash become more abundant. Now climbing through heather meadows, views to surrounding peaks begin and continue to grow. At 3.8 miles and 4,750 feet, the trail crests a small knoll. This is a perfect spot for feasting on food, scenery, and views if a shorter trip is all you've ordered. Kyes, Columbia, and other Monte Cristo peaks fill the horizon to the northwest while Wild Sky beauty Spire shows a snowy face to the southwest across Jacks Pass. But why stop? Your hard work is over with and the journey has only just begun! Now a true ridge walk, the trail follows the ridge crest up and down as it rolls along. At about 5.5 miles and 5,375 feet, the trail crosses into Henry M. Jackson Wilderness and you amble through parkland meadows teeming with wildlife -- keep an eye out for bears. At 6.9 miles and 5,500 feet, the route veers left at an easy-to-miss junction  near a cluster of mountain hemlock just after a pyramid shaped boulder. This makes a fine campsite if sleeping under the stars is on the agenda.The final 0.3 mile and 300 feet will bring you to Benchmark's elongated  summit and one of the most amazing views available in all of the central Cascades. Expect wildflowers and peaks all around. Feast your eyes until they've had their fill, then head for the huckleberries and feast some more.WTA Pro Tip: Make a full weekend of visiting the Wild Sky Wilderness by camping at the Beckler River Campground, noted for its peaceful atmosphere. 27 sites including multi-family and wheelchair access. River access is available while site privacy is provided courtesy of vine maples and shrubs. The campground is a good jump-off point for recreational activities in the North Fork Skykomish, Beckler River and West Fork Foss River areas.

This is a perfect hike if you want to get a feel for Washington's forests, though it's not necessarily indicative of what the rest of the National Volcanic Monument is like. The north side of St. Helens was the least affected by the 1980 blast, and the forest that the Goat Creek Trail winds through is home to huge, old trees that survived the eruption that obliterated the forests on the other side of the mountain. The trail leaves a small parking area large enough for five cars and traverses the hillside through quiet forest of red cedar and hemlock. Mossy rocks, and plenty of trailside distractions like chipmunks and slugs will keep kids entertained. Continue gently climbing to Cathedral Falls, the highlight of the hike. The trail provides an intimate, 360-degree view of the falls, leading hikers towards the base of an enormous waterfall, and then winding behind it. Hike under a cave and enjoy the spray from the falls, but be careful - the trail drops steeply away off to your left here and a wrong step can mean a far fall.After getting your fill of the falls, continue on for about a half mile until you arrive at a junction with Goat Creek.

The Columbia Springs Environmental Education Center has three main trails that range from 1/16 of a mile long, to 1/3 of a mile. The Hemlock Trail, found at the east end of the park, is the shortest, but arguably has the best diversity of scenery. Coming from the parking area, the full walk may be closer to 1/8 of a mile, but on the way, you'll pass the fish rearing ponds, including one where you can feed young rainbow and brown trout. Past the ponds is a short walk to the Cordwood Classroom. The trail begins just behind the classroom, but before you head there, go to the viewing area over West Biddle Pond. On sunny days, young trout can be seen warming themselves here. How many can you count? After watching the fish for a while, head behind the Cordwood classroom, where you'll see the Hemlock Trail heading off to the right. Stairs carry you down, just above thick groundcover and along the north side of West Biddle Pond. Climb back up on both stairs and trail, to a fork. The right hand trail loops back to the viewing platform for the 1/16 mile loop, but a very short side trail heads through an open grassy space and ends at a viewing platform over quieter East Biddle Lake. If it's a longer loop you're after, from the parking lot try either the Cedar Circle Trail or the slightly shorter Trillium Trail. Both are accessible from the west side of the parking area, though to reach the Cedar Circle Trail, you'll need to walk west on the sidewalk away from the parking area, looking for an unsigned trail on your right. Both trails go through thick understory and soaring deciduous canopy. Look for trillium at your feet, and various leaves and blooms above your head as you hike. Both of these trails loop around themselves and deliver you back to the parking area in less than a mile. Though the trails are not ADA-accessible, they are friendly to just about every other ability of hiker, and Columbia Springs is free and open to the public from dawn to dusk each day.","driving_directions":"Coming from Vancouver on Highway 14, take exit 5 for SE Ellsworth Road, and turn right.

This is a long hike, best done as a backpack, but it's absolutely worth the days you invest to explore here. Plan to spend at least five days tackling this trail, as the trail is a long one, and while the approach involves minimal elevation gain at first, once you start climbing up Miner's Ridge, you'll get quite a quad workout. Plus, the scenery is so gorgeous, and the potential for wandering so extensive, you'll be glad you set aside a few days to explore. Begin your quest to Image Lake from the newly-reopened Suiattle River Road. From the Suiattle River trailhead, located at the end of the road, hike 9.5 miles along the rushing, mighty Suiattle River. There are three camps sprinkled along this section of the trail, so you'll have somewhere to lay your head if you decide to camp down here on your first night. Along this 9.5 mile approach, you'll cross a suspension bridge over Canyon Creek and then come to your first junction .3 miles past the bridge. Take the left-hand trail, and continue on a gently inclining traverse for 2.5 miles to your turnoff for Miners Ridge. Shift into low gear and begin climbing; you'll go from 2800 feet to 6000 feet over the next 5.5 miles. The trail switchbacks relentlessly up, crossing several seasonal creeks. 3.3 miles in, arrive at a junction. Keep left here. Going right will take you to Suiattle Pass, Holden, even the little hamlet of Stehekin. All these are worthy jaunts, just not the one you're on today. Press on and up the switchbacks. 2.2 miles from the junction arrive at the top of the ridge. Here you can take a brief side trip to the Miner's Ridge lookout. This is only 0.4 miles away and 208 feet higher. It's a gorgeous lookout; one of the last ones still standing in good shape in the North Cascades, but it's closed to the public. Make the trek and take photos, but please respect the closure and do not attempt to enter. Once you've gotten your fill of views from here, head back to the junction at the top of the ridge. Continue on the right-hand fork, and after less than half a mile, you'll arrive at another junction. You're nearly there! Here, where the trail splits, you can go either way to circumnavigate the lake and find a camp spot. Be sure to get a spot and get settled before evening -- the alpenglow on Glacier Peak reflected in Image Lake is one of the most sought-after photos in professional circles.","driving_directions":"Drive Highway 530 north from Darrington or south from Highway 20 near Rockport.

On the northeast edge of the lake, Heritage Park is a setting for hikers and picnickers alike. Educational and historical markers from the county line the lake's edge, and wetlands to the south remind visitors of Washington's coastal areas. The bluff to the north echoes the drier side of the state. A trail connects Heritage Park to the Hillside Trail, which is a series of gentle switchbacks leading up to the Capitol Campus, with the impressive Capitol Building and access to downtown Olympia. Marathon Park is a small, 2-acre park across the lake from Heritage Park, which offers waterfront recreation for walkers, runners and joggers.

A mountain bike course, playground, and several picnic areas dot the trailside, and with various access points to the town of Castle Rock, it’s easy to duck off for a quick bite in town. Begin just south of town, at Lions Pride Park. The parking here can bit a bit unusual since it’s just an empty roadside lot with no delineated spots, but there is plenty of room and it’s infrequently crowded. Just be sure to leave room for other cars. From the parking lot, walk north along the paved trail. For the first quarter mile, the road parallels the Business Loop of I-5 through Castle Rock. While it’s not heavily traveled, traffic so near can be a bit disconcerting. Don’t worry – you’ll move away from it soon enough. Skirt the eastern edge of a large wooded hillside. Before the greenery grew up, this was recognizable as Castle Rock, the location after which the town nearby was named. Settlers built their homesteads in its shade, before the dike you are walking along was constructed to prevent flooding in the low lying farmland nearby. Now trees almost completely obscure the rock, but it remains a nice balance to the road nearby. Notice a wide graveled path making a large switchback up Castle Rock. This detour, while not ADA-accessible, does provide the only uphill available on this walk. If you take it, you’ll gain about 150 feet of elevation as you hike to the summit of the rock, where a covered picnic area awaits. Views are limited, thanks to the large trees that have grown up and around it, but the river glints through the leaves below, and it’s a nice spot to sit and enjoy your surroundings before continuing on. You can return to the trail the way you came up, or you can follow the other end of the loop to where it reconnects with the paved trail near milepost .3. As the trail turns away from the road, it begins to parallel the Cowlitz River. As you walk, look for interpretive signs telling of the history of the area, including past floods, the town's fishing and logging history, and the first settlers to the area.Just shy of a mile you’ll see a skate park on the left-hand side of the trail, and shortly after that are a mountain bike course and BMX bike course. Soon the trail dips below the A Street bridge over the Cowlitz and a bench near the river provides a nice spot to sit a while. Past the bridge are more picnic areas and access to the town of Castle Rock via a switchbacked ramp that links up to Shintaffer Avenue. Continue along the trail – there’s only about half a mile of it left! A boat launch is visible across the way, and fishermen are often active around here. As you walk past town, a small park on the right hand side that houses some cheerful flowers marks the end of the trail. It slopes downhill slightly to a large turn where a picnic table and another bench sit, perfect for watching the river slip by.","driving_directions":"From I-5 driving north, take exit 408 for the Castle Rock I-5 Business Loop.

This allows hikers to store resupply food and water in the car since no matter how one hikes it, one will need to pass back through the parking lot during the hike.The park can be roughly split into two halves, with four peaks each on the west and east sides.  The easiest order to hike is as follows, beginning on the west side:1.  Beauty Mountain (fifth tallest at 5,100 feet)2.  Mount Kit Carson (second highest at 5,282 feet)3.  Day Mountain (sixth highest at 5,057 feet)4.  Mount Spokane (tallest at 5,889 feet)Then pass through the parking lot to begin the east side portion on the Nordic trail system:5.

Ragged Mountain* (seventh highest at 4,900 feet) *Remember to call the park first to get permission to access this peak, located within a Natural Area Preserve. Access is limited to hikers only.This grand tour of the peaks also includes much of the park's history (the CCC cabin; the 1934 Vista House; the Cook's Cabin area, with the restoration project of the woodshed and site of the old ski lodge; the old Mount Spokane fire lookout, now a reservable rental on Quartz Mountain), as well as some unique alpine and sub-alpine ecosystems. The entire route is approximately 25 miles in length with only some overlap in trail traveled, but the hike could easily be split into shorter segments.

There are excellent viewpoints along the road, which snowshowers sometimes enjoy more than the lakes. On a clear day mountains such as Rampart Ridge, Kendall Peak, Granite Mountain, Silver Peak and even Mount Rainier line the distant horizon. Since the trailhead is about an hour from Seattle, the grade is gentle and the views superb, this is a popular destination. The route is relatively easy to follow because it follows an closed forest road. Experienced snowshoers who are good at route finding may go off the road and find their own routes to the lakes, but be aware of avalanche danger. The trail starts at the large sign in the Gold Creek Sno-Park. A Sno-Park permit is necessary to park your car here from December through March. From the Sno-Park parking lot follow the forest road in a northeast direction. It is flat for the first 0.3 miles then the road turns north and starts to climb. On weekends this area is a popular playground for family with inner tubes and sleds. As you climb higher the crowds thin out.At about 0.8 miles from the parking lot, the road turns sharply to the left. From here, more experienced snowshoers can go off the road and to find their own route. If you choose to stay on the road, follow it as it turns back on itself sharply to the right at about 1.3 miles from the parking lot. 1.6 miles from the parking lot, arrive at the base of a series of switchbacks. Here you can see Gold Creek Basin and Rampart Ridge to the east.From here, it is a long steady climb. There are places you can view mountains such as Silver Peak, Denny Mountain and Snoqualmie Summit ski area to the west. About three miles from the parking lot the road turns sharply right. Here again you can go off the road and find your own route if you are an experienced snowshoer, but take note - the incline of terrain here is steeper and more exposed than lower down. You must assess the avalanche danger. Following the road, you will reach a open flat area in about 0.3 mile. There is no view here, but if you continue south you reach a view point in another 0.3 mile. From this viewpoint, back track to the open flat area and continue going north on the road. This area is open and exposed. At about 3.8 miles from the parking lot, the road turns right yet again. Here, you'll head off the road and go north, traversing across mostly level open slopes for 0.2 miles, where you arrive at the first of the three lakes. It is possible to reach the middle lake through the forest, but avoid making for the third lake because the trail is steep and it is not safe to approach it in the winter.If you'd rather stay on the road, there are great views just 0.2 miles from where you head off for the lakes, at the end of the road. You can see Keechelus Lake, Rampart Ridge, and even Mount Rainier on a clear day.","driving_directions":"Drive east on I-90 to exit 54.

Enjoy the golden hills, the swift-flowing river that is a favorite of kayakers and spring wildflowers that begin bursting forth as early as February.This first section of the 31-mile Klickitat Trail is a rails-to-trails conversion from Lyle to Warwick (on the Lyle-Centerville Highway), with several access points along the way. The Klickitat River section runs 10 miles upriver from Lyle to the hamlet of Pitt paralleling the river the entire way. This is a multi-use trail, so expect to see bicyclists and equestrians along the way. Also, due to its proximity to private land, please stay to the trail, obey all signs and keep dogs leashed.From the new trailhead in Lyle, the first 1.6 miles to the Fisher Hill Bridge are easy walking on a paved trail. Take time to admire the new decking on the railway trestle. After the Fisher Hill Bridge, the trail is no longer paved as hikers embark on the more wild section of the trail. State Route 142 also parallels the river on the opposite side, but it is a fairly quiet stretch of road and does not impede on your hike too much. Instead, watch for kayakers maneuvering through the whitewater below. If you have only one car, find a nice place to lunch in this stretch and return to Lyle.If you have two cars, you'll want to do this as a one-way trip - and even better in reverse, going downstream from Pitt to Lyle. As you near Pitt, the trail gets closer to the river again. Houses appear on both sides of the river. Eventually you'll pop out. Cross the highway to a small parking lot with a privy.The Klickitat Trail continues until a major bridge wash-out just east of the town of Klickitat. It then picks up again on the other side - a fabulous section through Swale Canyon. This trail is a partnership between the Klickitat Trail Conservancy, Washington State Parks and the US Forest Service.","driving_directions":"Drive SR 14 east from Vancouver about 70 miles to the town of Lyle.

The grade isn't terribly steep, but hiking poles would help to keep you from sliding down after each step. There is another path to the left of the one that heads up the ridgeline from the trailhead which is less steep, but is harder to follow.After a little more than half a mile, stop to enjoy the view (and catch your breath) - you've just done 1100 feet of elevation gain! Take in the wide silver ribbon of the Columbia River and the rounded shoulders of the mountains around you. Closer in, take a look around your feet for wildflowers, and keep looking as you continue hiking. The flower show intensifies as you climb. The path fades in and out of visibility. When in doubt, refer to your map and follow the ridgeline. The route follows the ridge as it goes over several stairsteppy humps. Hike along a flat section, then climb steeply and then come to a little downhill. Repeat. The views continue to improve as the horizon expands. At every step, you'll enjoy 360 degree views and near total solitude. Be sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen, since this is a dry route and very exposed, with only two trees about halfway up the route that provide minimal shade. At the top there is a small building and tower that provide some shade. Take another rest; you've just done 3500 feet of elevation gain in 3.6 miles. That's a pretty good workout. Take the long and winding road down the hill, traversing at first and then dropping into the canyon and crossing a creek that runs across the road. This is your first water source on the hike, and nearby trees provide welcome, much-needed shade too.The views are outstanding. The wildflower show is superb. The solitude can be total.

Continue on, climbing very slightly through mixed conifer forests with a decent spread of old-growth timber. Along the river, look for sneaky Americandippers flying in and out of the water. At 3.3 miles, turn right on an abandoned road, the Blue Horse Trail, and cross the Kalama. On the other side, turn left to follow the Toutle Trail past a small waterfall and McBride Lake’s south shore. This meadowy river valley occasionally hosts grazing Roosevelt elk, as well as a happy collection of birds and small forest critters. The trail then climbs away from the lake, but this makes a good place to enjoy lunch before heading back by the same route.WTA Pro Tip: This trail winds in and out of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, so be sure to observe all posted signage, including pet restrictions.","driving_directions":"From Cougar, drive FR 90 east 1 mile past the Swift Dam.

Maple trees blaze red, orange and yellow in autumn, willows provide shade in spring, and the stark skeletons of those trees stand out against grey skies in winter. With various bridges crossing it, it's possible to venture all the way around it, or create smaller loops as needed. With ample parking around the lake, it's possible to begin walking at just about any point. But, by beginning at St. John's hospital, it is possible to take advantage of the \"Solar System Walk\". Dedicated in September of 2001, the Friends of Galileo Astronomy Club installed stone plaques along one side of the lake based on the Thousand-Yard Model of the solar system. As you walk the wide graveled path, you'll pass informative stone plaques representing all the planetary bodies including the moon and the sun in our solar system. Each one features details about the planet it represents including basic data and some interesting trivia. In order to see all of them, you'll want to stay on the path closest to the road (though you can follow the path when it dips below all the bridges, rather than having to cross the street)The plaques line the west side of the lake, so they'll guide you all the way from the south to the north end. From here, it's easy to complete your loop by walking around the north end of the lake, noting the water feature and heading south. Along the way you'll pass many trees (labeled with their species and common name), the entrance to a lovely Japanese Garden, cultivated on one of the islands in the lake, and the open area that serves as the grounds for the towns 4th of July logging festival. Soon, you'll pass a beautifully cultivated rhododendron garden. Stray from the gravel path and rock hop through the barkdust to enjoy the many varied species that bloom here, before rejoining the trail south. Further south, walk through a large playground with bathrooms and plenty of room for the kids to run around, and then pass the entrance to Lions Island. If you choose to cross onto the island, it's a nice side trip, and you can see a large totem pole up close. A visit to the lake can be a quick jog, a longer walk, or a day-long picnic and dawdle. Whatever you prefer, it's a nice way to spend a day.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take exit 36 for Longview.

At a healthy clip or a slow meander, this rail trail is fun at any speed!Purchased by the Rails to Trails Conservancy in the early 1990s and then donated to Washington State Parks, this rail trail almost didn’t happen. Land-use conflicts stalled the project, but the trail opened to the public soon after the creation of the Klickitat Trail Conservancy. Currently, the U.S. Forest Service, Washington State Parks and the Klickitat Trail Conservancy cooperatively manage this trail.The Klickitat Trail runs 31 miles, with multiple access points placed in unique areas, from grass plains and the rugged Swale Canyon along the Wild and Scenic Klickitat River, to oak-filled valleys dropping down to Lyle and the Klickitat’s mouth at the Columbia River. Bring your sense of adventure, as you’ll cross old railroad trestles, encounter some very large cows, and stumble across a strange mixture of artifacts, from discarded equipment and railroad spikes to bleached white animal skulls.What sets this rails-to-trails selection apart from others in the state is its unique landscape and the quickness in which that landscape changes from mile to mile along the way. You can find native grassland openings, endless rolling hills of gold flowers and sprinklings of purple larkspur. Although you pass in close proximity to private property in a few places, where a denser vegetation of dogwood, pine and various deciduous trees is thick, you quickly feel far removed, as the trail opens and falls in sync with the remote sections of the Klickitat River.Listen for the variety of songbirds, and watch the hills on either side for deer, grouse, marmots and turkeys. Many ponds can be found in certain areas, brimming with amphibians, turtles and red-winged blackbirds gliding from the cattails.

The Snoqualmie Tunnel is part of the 110-mile John Wayne Trail. This section is in Iron Horse State Park and is a must do for everyone! Views for most of your trip will be determined by the power of your headlamp, but there will be some sights on the other side. The attraction of this hike is the mysterious, dramatic tunnel itself. However, note that the tunnel is closed November 1st through May 1st, so plan your trip accordingly.After reaching the parking lot, find the trail opposite the bathrooms. Once on the trail look west and follow the wide gravel path toward a metal gate one tenth of a mile away. This gate blocks the trail but is easy to bypass on foot or on bike.At a third of a mile you will find the entrance to the tunnel. If it’s a warm day you will feel the cool air funneling out of the tunnel. This cool breeze may just send a shiver down your spine, reminding you of the long dark walk awaiting you. At this point, think about donning a jacket as even on the hottest summer day the tunnel stays cool, even chilly. With the damp air, water periodically dripping from the ceiling and the darkness, you will certainly feel cold without that coat. Some people will even bring gloves and a hat for the walk through. Just before entering the darkness, strap on your headlamp or dig your flashlight out of your pack. You don’t want to be looking for your light source in the dark! Did you check that they work and do you have spare batteries?Other than a slight curve to the left at the beginning, once you’re in the tunnel your hike is pretty straightforward, literally. You may even be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s prudent to remember that the tunnel is 2.3 miles long, so while the light may seem promising, the end of your hike is still a long ways off. The tunnel is wide and very tall so there’s plenty of room for all, as you go through this fascinating piece of Washington State history. The trail in the tunnel is in great shape with just a few potholes, which you can expect to find where water is dripping from the ceiling. Once through, you will find a few picnic tables, a pit toilet, a garbage can and some nice views of the neighboring Cascade Mountains along the I-90 corridor. If it’s a clear day try and find the lookout on top of Granite Mountain! After you've located the lookout and eaten a snack, head back into the tunnel for your return trip. This time though, you will not have the light at the end leading you until you reach the bend in the tunnel near the start on the east side.WTA Pro Tip: Wear reflective clothing. Bicyclists are faster than walkers and can come upon you quickly.

The trail winds thru the Stevens Pass Ski area, climbing for two miles to top of the hill, gaining 1000 feet along the way.  When snow is not present, the ski runs are covered in wildflowers and sun-loving shrubs. After crossing the ridge which forms the backbone of the ski area, the trail descends 500 fee, crossing a number of talus fields and ducking under the power lines, heading west. Once past the power lines, civilization retreats. The only sound is the occasional bird, and the marmots and pika’s chirping their ‘here come hikers’ warning.  The trail starts climbing again, recapturing the 500 feet lost from the top of the ski area, passing a small frog pond with the fancy name of Lake Susan Jane. The trail heads over a small unnamed pass, where you will find a junction with the Icicle Creek Trail 1551. You can look down on Lake Josephine shimmering 300 feet below and call it a day, or follow Trail 1551 down half a mile to the lake.If you're hiking the trail in August or later, you will likely meet PCT thru hikers heading north to Canada. These are fun folks to talk with, since they often have come all the way from the Mexican border. We frequently carry extra snacks; cherries or cookies are particularly good to share with thru hikers -- they'll light up when offered a fresh treat.  For full trail angel status, watch for thru hikers at Stevens Pass hitch-hiking down to Skykomish for a resupply. The thirty minute ride will be deeply appreciated and the stories they have can be inspiring.WTA Pro Tip: If you have a large group with two cars, you can turn this into a nice thru hike by having half the team start at the Tunnel Creek Trail and climb up to the junction with the PCT at Hope Lake. There, they can turn north and proceed 4 miles to Lake Josephine. There, you can swap keys and continue to the other trailhead.

At 1.25 miles, the trail comes within sight of Silver Creek as it falls into a narrow canyon. Beyond here, the grade is flatter, following the gently flowing Silver Creek upstream to a signed junction with the Beacon Ridge Trail #1315.3 at 2.0 miles, elevation 3800 feet.Go left and resume climbing steeply once again, but on narrower tread.  You are still in open forest, shaded by older growth trees now, but with ample light filtering in. The spur trail heads northwest, then loops around to the southwest. The final half mile is a straight line of uniform grade, basically a ramp heading south-southwest up to the ridge top and beacon at 2.9 miles, elevation 4600 feet.  Wander the ridgetop for views including Lake Easton, Mt. Rainier, and Kachess Lake.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive east on I-90 to exit 70, signed for Lake Easton State Park.

With huge extinct and active volcanoes on the horizon and an unbelievable bounty of flowers in the spring and huckleberries in the fall, Jumbo lives up to its name--stunning surroundings on a grand scale. Starting from the Sunrise Peak trailhead, head southwest on the rough trail. It's a short but steep slope for about three-quarters of a mile to a lovely viewpoint featuring Mount Adams to the south, and ahead of you, Jumbo Peak's jauntily placed summit block slopes away to the northwest. Continue along the trail--now quite a bit flatter than what you just ascended--wending your way around Sunrise Peak's flanks to a junction one mile from the trailhead. Your route lies straight ahead, though the trail heading up to Sunrise Peak is a worthy diversion if you have the time. If you do, it's two miles round trip, including a bit of scrambling to achieve the very top. If you elect to head straight to Jumbo, proceed along the trail in front of you, gently descending for 0.3 miles to another T junction. Turn left here, the right hand trail is the multi-use access to Sunrise Peak.Continue your gentle descent to where the trail flattens out in a hanging valley. If you're doing an overnight, this is an excellent spot for dispersed campsites, but take note that there is unlikely to be any water here.Hike through the flat section and begin climbing yet again, now on the flanks of Jumbo Peak. The trail is moderately to steeply graded, but views northeast to Rainier and Sunrise Peak keep you distracted and there are plenty of photo opportunities. Round Jumbo's northern flank and continue to a saddle with in-your-face views of Mount Adams. From the saddle, the trail begins yet another climb to a false summit, but don't lose heart! Once at the false summit you'll have your first breathtaking views that will stick with you to your lunch spot. Now it's a relatively flat meadow walk through unbelievable vistas in every direction. In spring, beargrass, paintbrush, and phlox dot the meadows and in fall, you'll have more than enough huckleberries to fuel your hike. This route doesn't actually go to the summit of Jumbo, but rather circumnavigates it. Head around the west side of the mountain, enjoying views of St. Helens along the way. The trail here becomes quite narrow in places. Remember that this is a multi-use trail, and in the Dark Divide, that includes motorized vehicles, so be aware of the possibility that you may meet oncoming trail users and observe good trail etiquette. Soon you'll arrive at an open meadow with rocks--great for sitting and snacking while enjoying the views all around you. Adams, St. Helens, and the Goat Rocks are visible here, as well as Dark Meadow and Holdaway Butte nearby.WTA Pro Tip: Jumbo Peak can also be accessed from Dark Meadow or other feeder trails.

While you won’t see much of Pine Creek, you will see plenty of pines—and firs and hemlocks too—in pretty forest at the edge of the Muddy River lahar.Start in old-growth timber following a wide and gentle trail to the east of Pine Creek. Shortly after passing through an old cut, reach the 1920s-built Adirondack style shelter (elev. 3020 ft) near a dry streambed at 0.4 mile. The historical shelter is in great shape thanks to a group of volunteers who restored it in 1991.

Jack pines can be found in the Canadian Shield and a few places in the US upper Midwest and Northeast. The pines growing near the shelter are lodgepole and western white pines, although hemlocks and firs are more prevalent in the surrounding forest.The trail continues beyond the shelter, but it’s not maintained. It can still be followed, though, if you don’t mind stepping over a few downed trees.

For one thing, the year-round access point is through an off-road OHV park, which visitors may need to hike through to reach the wilderness gate. For another, the whole of the 7,140-acre wilderness is enclosed by a fence. Old tire tracks that predate wilderness designation are still visible in some areas within the fence that keeps OHVs out, illustrating just how fragile this ecosystem is.Although it's impossible to leave behind the sounds of the OHV park, inside the wilderness gate the landscape is drastically different. Near the southern end of the wilderness, native grasses are generally out-competing noxious weeds blown in on the wind, and the hills are gently undulating. The farther north one travels, the denser the vegetation generally becomes, and the hills become steeper. Grass gives way to low shrubs and tall sagebrush to the northwest, and Washington's largest remaining juniper groves dominate the north and northeast.  The wilderness is home to diverse wildlife, both common and rare. Tracks and scat will be the main indicator of the flourishing populations, but it is likely visitors will be able to at least catch a glimpse of the numerous deer and coyotes within the wilderness. The juniper berries attract a large population of birds, especially in winter when forage elsewhere is scarce. Rare animals that can be found here include sagebrush lizard, black-tailed jackrabbit, grasshopper mouse, kangaroo rat, ferruginous hawk, and Swainson's hawk.                                                                                                                                                                 When planning a trip to Juniper Dunes, keep in mind that the wilderness limit is 8 heartbeats. Know that an overnight permit is required for backpacking, available for free by contacting the BLM office in Spokane.  Campfires are strictly prohibited, and visitors must be well-versed in Leave No Trace ethics. While dogs are not prohibited, the rugged nature of this area may mean it's best to keep dogs at home, or at least on a short leash. Many of the noxious weeds near the wilderness fence have thorns, and the southern portion of the wilderness area contains numerous beds of cacti. There are also no water sources within the wilderness area, so all water necessary for the trip must be carried in. Hikers need to be well versed in map and compass navigation skills when visiting here. There are numerous game trails crisscrossing the wilderness, but no maintained hiking trails.  Although the entire wilderness is fenced, and walking the boundary would total roughly 15 miles, a visitor would get little sense of the wild nature of this wilderness by sticking to the fence line. With USGS maps and compass bearings, perhaps backed by GPS waypoints, the best way to really see this unique ecosystem is to strike off across the rugged center. While the difference between the highest point and lowest point of this wilderness amounts to approximately 300 feet, the rolling nature of the landscape means hikers will gain and lose elevation many times, and can easily lose sight of distant landmarks. Loose footing contributes to the more difficult nature of hiking here.","driving_directions":"From Highway 395 near Pasco, travel east on US 12 to the junction with the Pasco-Kahlotus Highway.

Turn west on Peterson Road, a rough, increasingly narrow and bumpy gravel road.  Continue four miles to the first of the BLM kiosks within the OHV park and park in the open parking area approximately 100 yards beyond the kiosk if the ground is dry and the sand is soft. It is a 3.5 mile walk through the OHV area from here to the wilderness boundary. For those in high clearance vehicles, and only during times of the year when the sand contains adequate moisture, it is possible to continue down the rough OHV main road. Watch for the poorly marked Wilderness Road on the right just before the road passes a natural gas pipeline and below the main electrical lines. A single green fence post with no signage marks the intersection. The Wilderness Road is little wider than a car and may be blocked in places by windblown tumbleweeds (easily cleared from the roadbed, but keep leather gloves in the car for this purpose as the weeds contain thorns).

Start at the Kautz Creek trailhead from Paradise Road and wind your way through the woods for roughly one mile until reaching the Kautz Creek crossing. Here you’ll find a small footbridge that may be snow-covered during the winter. Use caution when crossing, as footing can be difficult with ice and snow buildup. From the crossing, you’ll begin an upward climb out of the creek basin  toward Mount Rainier, gaining roughly 2,500 feet over 3 miles until the first views of the surrounding mountains are apparent. The climb from Kautz Creek is largely spent switchbacking up the hillside under the cover of dense trees, but the forest is enchanting here with a fresh coat of snow and the teasing glimpses of the Tatoosh Range through the pines will lure you to the top where better sights await. After another bridge crossing you’ll be somewhere near the halfway mark of the climb and another couple sets of switchbacks past this will mark the end of the steepest section.

Both trails are two and a half miles long, but the one beginning at Little Wenatchee Falls campground gains a full 3000 feet in elevation. It's guaranteed to get your heart pounding, but Irving Pass is the recommended route, since you spend a significant amount of the hike on the ridge with awesome views both north and south.  Although numerically easier, you'll still get your workout hiking in via Irving Pass; this route hikes harder than it reads on paper. However you reach it, the old lookout site on Poe provides excellent views in all directions. There are no stream crossings, springs or reliable water on this trail so make sure you are adequately supplied. There can be easily crossed snow drifts until midsummer on this trail, so be sure to check WTA's trip reports (below) for current conditions.The first tenth of a mile of the hike is in the sunshine of an old clear cut.  Then the trail climbs 500 feet in a half mile on a well-maintained, moderately switchbacked trail to Irving Pass. After a brief water and snack break, head left on Trail #1545. Nearby, there is an unmaintained trail used by high country hunters that proceeds straight down into Cockeye Creek. It's not your route, and with a name like that, it's worth avoiding.The ridge trail quickly delivers its views; you are walking between trees that have somehow found room to root in the 15 foot flat space on the top of the ridge which drops south to the Little Wenatchee River and north into the White River drainage. Approximately three-quarters of a mile up the ridge is the one challenging point on the trail. Traverse north around a large rock knob. Early in the season this area can be choked with late snow -- if it looks impassible come back another day.  But if the snow is gone, you will be able to proceed 50 yards and do a short, steep climb to rejoin the ridge. Recently an old climbing rope has been left to provide a secure hand up across this section. Once back on the ridge, the views continue off both sides of the trail. In about a mile, climb to what you thought was the summit only to find the true summit in the distance, another half mile away. This section of the trail passes through a number of dense huckleberry patches. Snow can linger in the low swale before the summit. You will come upon a Y junction in the trail, where there is the remnant of a sign post, in the middle of the Y.  Go up to the right. A left here will hook up with Trail #1520 coming up on the other side of the peak.  There are spectacular views from the top of Poe looking north to Glacier Peak,  west up Meander Meadow to Kodak Peak, south to Rock Mountain, and on a clear day Rainer is visible.","driving_directions":"From Seattle: Drive east on Highway 2 to Stevens Pass, then go an additional 3.5 miles and make a left on Forest Road 6700 (signed for Smithbrook), just after the highway divides.

The popular trail system is located in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest at the base of Mount St. Helens and offers plenty of winter recreation for snowshoers, cross-country skiers, and snowmobilers. An easy ramble to June Lake follows a creek through a gorgeous winter wonderland, complete with an icicle-laced waterfall.Start at the Marble Mountain Sno-Park parking lot and follow the often-groomed Pine Marten Trail No. 245E, which parallels the road. You can take the road instead if you’d like, but it’s mostly for snowmobiles. The Pine Marten Trail is much more enjoyable.

The John Wayne Pioneer Trail in Iron Horse State Park provides access to notable North Bend hikes, views of mountains and waterfalls, and a journey back into Washington’s history. Take in the wildlife and cross soaring bridges as you make a level traverse from Rattlesnake Lake to Change and Hall Creeks 5.5 miles to the east.The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad operated from 1908 until 1980, when it went bankrupt. The Department of Natural Resources acquired the railroad’s land, forming the 100-foot-wide Iron Horse State Park that traverses the state from east to west. The park contains more than 100 miles of trail from Cedar Falls to the Columbia River, all of it with a grade of 2.2% or less. The John Wayne Pioneer Wagons and Riders Association helped create the trail, which is named after the Association, rather than the actor.From the Iron Horse State Park parking area, find the signs for Iron Horse State Park, which will lead you to the broad state-crossing track. When you reach a sign indicating mileages to destinations including Twin Falls and McClellan Butte, you have reached the John Wayne Pioneer Trail. Make a left to head east. The trail is lined by bigleaf maple, alder, western hemlock, Douglas fir, salmonberry, and thimbleberry. Falls colors can be spectacular. Squirrel and chipmunks squeak at you, and bald eagles and red-tailed hawks may circle overhead.At 1 mile, cross over Boxley Creek with its outflow measuring station and pass the Cedar Butte trailhead on the right. Continue onward under the canopy, passing the falls of Boetzke Creek and then the abandoned train depot of Ragnar about 1 mile later. The trail still has the railroad’s mileposts, and many railroad artifacts are at Ragnar. Please feel free to enjoy these and take photographs, but leave them in place for other hikers to appreciate after you. At 4.5 miles, pass the eastern terminus of the Twin Falls trail, on the left. Just 0.5 miles later, the unmarked trail to Mount Washington dips briefly between two large alders and begins its brutal ascent.At 5.5 miles, reach the first of two towering trestles over Change and Hall Creeks.

At the time it was built, it was considered the best engineered of the transcontinental railroads. Your journey will take you on one of the intricate switchbacks that once started trains up the Cascades Mountains. Start out at the Martin Creek trailhead, and here you will now find a wonderful trail for hikers with physical challenges. The first part of this loop contains almost three miles of ADA accessible trail, and it is both interesting and beautiful. It is a wide gravel trail with wooden bridges across small creeks making the journey easy on wheelchairs. Admire the small waterfalls coming down. There are several old tunnels with trails going up to the opening, and collapsed timbers that once were protection from the snow. Note the dates stamped in the concrete at the entrance of the tunnels. Many of the tunnels and snow bridges were built after the Wellington Avalanche Disaster to better protect the trains from snow. Pause and read the interpretive signs in front, but the tunnels are unsafe to enter! There are more than tunnels and timber to tell the rail story. Interpretive signs along the way also tell of the people that built the railway. In a little over three miles, reach the paved turn off to the right and the start of the alternative trailhead by the red caboose. Stop here, let the little kids climb on the red caboose while the big kids read the display and check out the history. There are vault toilets here too.                                                                      To take the upper loop, follow the signs to the Windy Point crossover trail left at the junction. This is a steep switchbacking trail that gains elevation much faster than a train could. At the top, this trail intersects with the upper trail. You can go to the right and on to the Wellington trailhead for a longer hike, adding almost six miles to your total. For a nice lunch stop and good views of Stevens Pass, surrounding peaks and the present railroad line, take the right trail for just a quarter of a mile to the Windy Point viewpoint. There are some nice lunch rocks and if you are lucky, you might hear, or see pikas. To make the loop and return to Martin Creek, take the left upper trail, a rougher trail than the lower one. This trail will take you by the remnants of several snow sheds. There are usually waterfalls coming off the top of some of them. Notice the signs beside the trail with numbers, these are the miles to (or from) Chicago, where the railroad originated. It is worth taking the Spillway Spur stairs just to see where the old reservoir once was. The new Cascade Tunnel was opened in 1929 and the old grade abandoned. Perhaps you can hear the whistle of a train climbing over the mountains even now. Follow the Martin Creek crossover back to your car.WTA Pro-Tip: Read ‘The White Cascade’ by Gary Krist, an account of the Wellington Avalanche Disaster, then hike the rest of the trail to the Wellington trailhead with a deeper appreciation of history and our Cascade mountain weather.","driving_directions":"Take Hwy 2 toward Stevens Pass, to milepost 55.

Most of the trail stays well clear of water bodies, so the skeeter population is relatively low. The first section of trail is far from spectacular, but there are unbeatable views once you climb into the beautiful high country on the second half of the route.Start the hike by walking up the old dirt road. You'll soon come to a relatively new section of trail climbing steeply away from the old road. Follow this reconstructed trail for nearly 0.5 mile through dense forest before erupting out of the trees onto the upper section of the road. Another short walk (well, about 0.5 mile of walking, actually) along the roadway leads to the start of the true Three Peaks Trail. Here, the payoffs begin. Once you hit the end of the road and venture out on the ridge-top trail, the scenery becomes increasingly more awesome. Indeed, the trail really improves shortly after it enters the Goat Rocks Wilderness about 3 miles from the car. The forest gets brighter-old-growth with a varied canopy to let in more light-and the views start to open up more. You'll find a great vista down into the Packwood Lake basin and south to Johnson Peak. Be sure to carry plenty of water, since there is no water at the trailhead and the only water along the route is at the turnaround point near Mosquito Lake.","driving_directions":"From Packwood, drive 2 miles east on U.S. Highway 12 and turn right (south) onto Forest Road 1266.

A good stop if you have a car full of restless children or you are  showing off the area to visiting relatives. The views from the top are a big payoff for such a short hike. Begin your hike by walking through the campground along the well signed trail for Thunder Knob. Reach a braided Colonial Creek and cross on a series of bridges. This creek has been known to be a bit temperamental, changing directions and flooding everything in its path. If you are hiking this in the winter, be aware that the bridges are taken down at the end of the summer season to prevent the river damaging them.Once across the river, you will see the former rocky creek bed. Follow the rock-lined path through it, and end up at the edge of the forest. Enter the forest and notice how beautifully green it is, a mossy carpet under the hemlock and salal and draped over decaying logs. As you work your way up a bit higher, watch how the forest changes in just a matter of a few hundred feet. Now it is a drier forest of lodgepole pine, the ground is more rocky and exposed, the moss gone. The forest you just hiked through is just low enough to catch moisture, while the higher trail shows the effect of a small rain shadow created by the surrounding peaks.Rest on one of the benches, or take a few pictures of Colonial Peak at this first viewpoint. After the viewpoint, the trail climbs a little, then heads down and across a marsh. The marsh can be quite scenic when full of water, reflecting the grasses at the edge, but may dry up later in the season.From the marsh, hike up and reach the top of Thunder Knob.  A short spur to the left will take you to benches to rest, eat a snack (but watch out for thieving chipmunks), and take in the views. From this viewpoint, look below you at the clear turquoise water of Diablo Lake (actually a reservoir) and Diablo Dam in the distance. Diablo Dam was completed in 1930 and at 389 feet was the highest dam in the world at that time. The beautiful opaque turquoise water is a result of 'rock flour', silt that is carried downstream from underneath melting glaciers high in the peaks above. The tiny particles are suspended in the water and the way the light is reflected off the lake is perceived by our eyes as the striking blue green. If you hike earlier in the year, the color will be bluer, in late summer, the color will be greener.Look up and see the ridge of Sourdough Mountain and the snowfield of Davis Peak. A short trail leads to another viewpoint, looking across toward Jack Mountain and down toward the narrow channel of Diablo Lake. The valley still looks steep and wild; imagine for a minute what the Skagit River and this valley once looked like before the dams were built. Return along the same path. WTA Pro Tip: There is so much to see and do in the North Cascades. Stay at Colonial Creek campground and hike more of the many trails close by. The Pyramid Lake trail is a fairly short trail signed just after you cross Gorge Lake. The Thunder Creek trail is long but gentle as it follows Thunder Creek up a wild valley. It takes off at the end of the campground on the other side of highway 20. On your way back, stop and hike to Ladder Falls, a short hike behind the power plant in Newhalem. At night, this path has a colored light show.","driving_directions":"Take Highway 20 east past Newhalem. Cross Gorge Lake, and follow the shoreline of Diablo Lake until you reach Colonial Creek campground, past milepost 130. Turn left and park at the trailhead to the right of the campground entrance.  The trail starts here, not in the campground. There is a pit toilet somewhat hidden behind a tree, and flush toilets along the campground entrance road, open when the campground is.

Thompson Lake provides a great destination for day hikers or overnighters in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. You may even find solitude here, just off the I-90 corridor. But that solitude comes at a price. The trail up to Mount Defiance can be trying, especially in the height of summer. Climbing moderately, and then steeply away from Mason Lake, hikers are eventually rewarded with fields full of flowers and a gorgeous panorama from the summit of Defiance. But at the end of the traverse just below the summit, a little bootpath descends quietly into the forest. This is the trail to Thomspon Lake: a large, scenic lake with nice alpine boulder fields and great views of the interior of Alpine Lakes Wilderness and Pratt river valley. Here, a number of small forested islands catch the sunlight in morning and evening, providing a relaxing panorama if you've chosen to camp. From the traverse on Defiance, follow the narrow, somewhat brushy trail over to the north side of Defiance Ridge. 2.6 miles of ridgeline traverse bring you to yet another backbone, where you may be able to spot Spider Lake and creek in the basin to the southeast. But you're heading to the northwest. Thompson Lake lies at the base of several steep switchbacks, just 0.8 miles away. The lake has some good campsites. The main area is across the inlet stream just after you cross the stream on some logs when you finally get down the switchbacks. The trail around the lake passes a junction with trail 1009A and 0.3 miles past that junction are some smaller sites.

We suggest getting the Interpretive Trail Guide from the Visitor's Center, which is closed on Sundays. Try incorporating all three trails by doing the hike as a figure-eight loop. Snake Lake is a 17-acre serpentine-shaped lake and wetland area in the preserve. Home to the spectacularly colored wood duck, which is frequently seen at the first bridge, the lake also hosts mallards and Canada geese, common year-round residents. The plants and animals that live here are representative of those that share life with us in an urban environment.

The trail is usable all year unless there has been significant lowland snow. In spring, enjoy blooms of trilliums and other wild flowers. In the fall, appreciate the colors of leaves that carpet parts of the trail.The TMT initially follows the grade of the former Woods and Iverson railroad, built in the 1920s to haul timber from the Tigers to a mill in Hobart. It's a quieter walk today, although you may hear occasional traffic sounds from nearby Highway 18.If you are hiking in early spring, be alert for some of the first trilliums to bloom in the Tigers. As the season progresses, other wildflowers will follow. Most of your hike is in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest, and in the autumn sections of the trail will be carpeted with the browns and golds of fallen maple leaves.The first mile of your hike gains 500 feet along second-growth forested hillsides. The final 0.9 miles has little elevation change. Your hike follows trails shared seasonally with trail riders (equestrians) and, at 1.1 miles, a sign directs riders to turn onto the \"Horse Bypass\" while your foot trail continues straight ahead. In another 0.2 mile, your trail narrows and traverses the steep hillside of Carkin's Cliff - the reason horses take a different route. (Names such as \"Carkin's\" honor volunteers who helped construct the TMT in the 1960s.) Beyond the traverse, arrive at the sign identifying Hobart Gap, where the foot and horse trails rejoin.From Hobart Gap, continue a short way east on the TMT as it follows the route of another 1920s logging railroad. In 0.3 mile or so, come to the crossing of a small creek. It's a tributary of Holder Creek, and early in the season the creek will be flowing with a bit of white water visible upstream of the trail. This is a pleasant spot to stop and, for an easy hike, it makes a good turn-around point. Or, if your enthusiasm and energy permit, some hike extensions are possible.Extending Your HikeFeeling more ambitious? If an extra 2.5 miles or so, and 300 feet of additional elevation gain, does not sound daunting, consider a loop hike all the way around South Tiger Mountain, returning to Hobart Gap via the South Tiger Traverse. For details, see South Tiger Mountain Loop in our Hiking Guide.Also, the TMT itself rambles on much farther, eventually reaching the High Point Trailhead on I-90 some 15 miles from your trailhead today. There are many potential turn-around points along the way, so a hike on the TMT can be as long as you like.

But you can see everything from the north trailhead in one reasonable-length out-and-back day hike.Yes, the beginning of the trail is steep, but at least most of the elevation gain is done in the shade. Begin by ascending through moderately open forest sprinkled with a few old growth trees. Undergrowth is sparse among the trees, but the trail is bordered by blueberries and huckleberries at various places, and even a patch of wild strawberries. At two miles, the trail breaks free of the tree canopy into sloped open meadow. At 2.4 miles, where the trail continues straight uphill on some stone steps, an unmarked path is visible to the left. This leads to a viewpoint of Mount Rainier in 0.3 mile, and eventually into the National Park. But much better views are straight ahead.The Tatoosh Trail is seldom flat; most of it is along a steep sidehill covered in wildflowers. Lingering snow could make it somewhat treacherous and also difficult to follow. Even when fully melted out, the trail is concealed by its surrounding vegetation, often preventing you from seeing where it is heading.Continue to 2.5 miles and a signed junction with Tatoosh Lakes Trail 161B at 5600 feet. This spur trail climbs 150 feet, crests over a ridge, then drops over 600 feet to two picturesque lakes tucked into a cirque. The lake basin is closed to camping.If you choose to go further, continue south-southeast from the junction, contouring along the steeply sloped natural meadowlands. Views of Mount Rainier open up behind you until at a small pass at three miles, the trail heads east and slightly downhill, blocking the views of Mount Rainier temporarily. The mileage shown in this guide assumes a turnaround point here.To get to the site of the former Tatoosh Lookout, continue over and around the small pass, heading east, then south once again, passing beneath Tatoosh Peak and a frequent rock slide area at 3.6 miles.At 4.5 miles and 5800 feet is the signed junction for trail 161A to Tatoosh Peak. Switchback sharply to the left and begin climbing on it. The 0.7 mile spur trail is somewhat rutted and can be windy once you are on the exposed ridge. From the former lookout site at 6400 feet, a turquoise tarn is visible below, providing a photogenic foreground for Mount Rainier, to the north. On a clear day, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, and Mount St. Helens are also visible, scanning from south to southwest.","driving_directions":"From the eastern end of Packwood, turn north from Highway 12 onto Skate Creek Road S.

While it may lack the elevation of Mount Spokane, it more than makes up for it with superior views; pack a picnic lunch and take advantage of the outstanding vista. As dense forest yields to the summit area's  open meadows and spectacular old growth trees, one can view Newman Lake and spot Antoine Peak Conservation Area to the southeast. To the south, the Foothills Community shows off its agricultural roots in the early to late summer with checkerboard fields of green pasture grass and alfalfa hay fields interspersed with bright yellow canola fields and golden wheat plantings. To the west lies Chattaroy, with additional farm land broken up by larger patches of timber. To the north, one can see the southern peaks of the Selkirk Range, while to the northeast, Mount Spokane's forested backside and bald pate dominates the view. From the summit of Mount Kit Carson, Trail 160 continues along the northern flank of the peak, allowing one to extend the hike to the saddle between Mount Kit Carson and Day Mountain where it intersects Trail 130. This is a good option for anyone looking to bag two peaks for the price of one. Since Trail 160 is only accessed via other park trails rather than having its own trailhead, there are several options available for where to begin one's hike. The shortest option is to begin at the Cook's Cabin trailhead along the summit road. From the trailhead, cross the road and begin the hike along the Upper Mount Kit Carson Loop Road, a former auto route that's now converted to park trail. Consider stopping at the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Cabin to admire the historic site and artistic rock work (interpretative signs will be installed during the summer of 2014). From this trailhead it's one mile to Saddle Junction and the Trail 160 intersection. Another potential starting point for this hike is the switchback parking lot at the Lower Mount Kit Carson Loop Road. The longer approach via Trail 110 to Saddle Junction allows one to ascend through some of the most spectacular bear grass displays in the park, and offers the potential to find huckleberries beginning in August. At the top, catch your breath and take in the all-encompassing views.  The valleys may be shrouded in their layer of fog, but up here, the sun is generally shining.  When the fog is absent, look east to pick out Idaho lakes (Hauser), Washington lakes (Newman), the communities from Coeur d'Alene all the way to the city of Spokane, plus Chattaroy to the northwest and the Selkirk Mountains to the north before returning to Saddle Junction and trail 140.WTA Pro-Tip: This year-round trail is shared with snowmobile use during the winter, and the summit and meadows area of Mount Kit Carson is a designated off-trail snowmobile \"play area.\" Be aware of this as you travel here in the winter months. Note: Trail 160 between Saddle Junction and the summit of Mount Kit Carson is scheduled to be rerouted during the summer of 2014.

Enjoy a moderately graded that leads you to a summit that boasts views of Rainier and the White River valley. Follow the White River Trail south along the highway to find the trailhead for the Ranger Creek Trail. Start here, and climb gradually through imposing old-growth forest, passing trees laden with moss. The abundance of life surrounding you is humbling.Keep an eye out for mobile life, too! Lots of different critters make their home here, though they can be quick and hard to catch a glimpse of. Look up for squirrels and birds flitting through the canopy, and look down for other creatures hunkered down in the underbrush.Continue climbing through the valley for a little more than two miles, until a sharp turn in the trail takes you away from a fork of Ranger Creek. Head up the sides of the mountain using several long, winding switchbacks, until you arrive at the \"summit\" -- six miles from the trailhead.

Two sparkling alpine lakes, an abundance of wildflowers, an impressive mountainous backdrop and a year-round snowfield make this a hike that will please everybody. What's more, this trail gets a fraction of the foot traffic that the trails at Artist Point get in late summer.Bagley Lakes can be done in a loop, though families with very small children might opt to go out and back. Start at the large parking lot signed for Bagley Lakes and the Wild Goose trails. Just past the trailhead, take a right turn and head down about 60 feet to Lower Bagley Lake at the foot of Mount Herman. At the lake, choose the left fork (signed Bagley Lakes Loop), and hike along the trail that runs along the east side of the lake.The way is easy for little feet, and children will delight in the wildflowers along the trail. As you reach the upper end of the lake, the source turns into a burbling creek for the next quarter mile as the views of Table Mountain and the cirque below it open up. At Upper Bagley Lake, cross over the creek on an arching stone bridge and walk along its northwest shore. There are places to dip toes into the freezing water or to simply contemplate the majesty of the area.A good destination for a short outing is the year-round snowfield at the upper part of the lake. To get there requires some sure-footedness around a stone wall. Kids can throw a snowball or two and everyone can admire the braided waterway as it runs down to form the lake. Do make sure that no one plays on top of the snow bridge above the creek; it could break.To return, go back to the stone bridge. To complete the loop, choose the Chain Lakes trail that runs along the opposite side of Lower Bagley Lake. That way is a bit harder than the trail on the way in, crossing some rocks and seasonal streams - but it is still quite easy for most kids over four.

Usually snow-free throughout winter, it's a beautiful place. The trailhead for Beaver Lake enjoyed a refresh in late 2014, creating a large parking area complete with privy and informational kiosk. The trail follows an old railroad bed, and offers a flat, rambling walk along the Sauk River, perfect for kids and adults alike.Because it's so close to the river, the trail has always been notorious for muddy conditions. But a lot of improvements have been done on the trail, and with few exceptions, the trail drains much better than it has in the past. However, only so much can be done for a flat trail in clayey soils -- bring waterproof boots, or at least ones you don't mind getting a bit wet. There's also a reroute meant to address a former slide area, but it still dips down near the river, and the slope has recently slumped again. The tread is still there, but it's a bit closer to the river than it was before, and the edge is abrupt and soft. Watch kids along this section. The alders, mosses & lichen, the reddish salmon-berry stalks and the lovely turquoise of the river make for a colorful walk. Look out too for the pond's namesake; industrious beavers build their dams here, increasing the surface area of the pond annually. You can see several beaver dams from the bridge that spans the largest ponds. Immediately after crossing the bridge, there's a grove of huge western red cedars. Certainly continue past the bridge for this! About 5 minutes beyond, the trail ends abruptly where the river had washed away the slope in 1990 - a very good year for washouts. On clear days, Mount Pugh is visible from here. But on foggy days it's equally beautiful, mist swirling around the trees creates a different kind of pretty scenery.

The first mine claim near Copper City was filed by James T “Cap” Simmons in 1889. Many other claims soon followed. A man named Reuben Root eventually bought the claim at Copper City and he is credited with sparking and maintaining investment interest in the area. By 1906 many claims in the area had been consolidated into the Copper Mining Company group.By 1910 Copper City had cabins, a bunkhouse, a sawmill, a blacksmith shop, and an ore mill. An elaborate water system provided the cabins with running water and newly installed telephone lines allowed communication with the outside world. The ore mill at Copper City separated rock that contained precious metals from non-valuable “country rock”. The resulting concentrated ore was then transported by horse and cart to a railroad line which in turn transported it to a smelter in Tacoma. The smelter completed the process of extracting the precious metals from the ore. In 1917 the US Bureau of Mines reported that the Copper Mining Company had shipped five tons of ore to the smelter. This ore contained 170 ounces of silver and 1,486 pounds of copper. When plans were made to run a rail line directly to Copper City, the town’s founders hoped the increased accessibility would cause a boom. Much to their disappointment the tracks were never put down. In the end the mines around Copper City never produced the riches that were expected. In 1948 all of the machinery in the town was moved to more profitable mining areas.To reach Copper City you will walk the old mine-to-market road into town. On your left you will see the mostly-collapsed remains of the bunkhouse, and a little farther on you will encounter the remnants of the old ore mill.","driving_directions":"From Enumclaw, drive east on Highway 410 for about 64 miles.

Begin in the eastern section of this Bellevue park and hike a series of trails for a satisfying loop through dark second-growth forest. Then, follow a connecting trail over to the western section of the park for a loop though the Bellevue Botanical Garden - both the formal gardens and some additional longer forest trails. Along the way brave a high, narrow trail bridge that crosses a deep ravine. Not enough? Multiple spur trails throughout the park invite further exploration.The park is named for the logging town of Wilburton that thrived here around 1900. Nothing remains of that town today, and the area has become a park where healthy second-growth forest can be appreciated. For your hike, it will be helpful to download a map of park trails fromparkstrails.myparksandrecreation.com/Details.aspx?pid=477Click on \"Detailed Map of Wilburton Hill Park Trails\" (Not on Map/Directions)If you prefer, you can set out with the map in hand and explore on your own. Or, here is a suggested route that gets to the most interesting parts of the park, and offers some ideas for hike extensions.Begin at the northeast corner of the parking lot. For your first loop (about 1.5 miles,) head east on the obvious wide trail past the restrooms. At the trail sign, turn left on the trail that climbs a few feet before circling part way around the baseball field. Soon, your route plunges into darker forest, and you will be surrounded by tall deciduous trees mixed with a number of tall second-growth Douglas firs.Frequent signed spur trails lead out to neighborhood side streets - you can pass them by or can explore them, as you like. On the main trail you will come to an unsigned Y. The better option here is to stay left. As you continue on the main trail you will pass additional optional side trails. Eventually, looming up ahead, you will see an odd, red geometric structure. It's part of a playground located near the southern end of the parking lot, and you will complete your first loop there.From the parking area, an optional side trail heads 0.3 miles south, initially following a power line. Explore it if you like, although you'll have to come back the same way. The trail drops a bit, bridges a small creek (often, just a trickle) and ends at a T-junction. The arms of the T lead out (east) to a school or (west) to Lake Hills Connector, a busy city street. The route is forested all the way, and can be a pleasant addition to your hike if you have the time and inclination.Back at the parking area, head west on the gravel trail that passes around the southern edge of the soccer field. (The field itself offers a striking visual contrast. It's all artificial, of course, both the bright green \"turf\" and the bordering red jogging path.) A few feet beyond the soccer field a small pond is visible off the trail on the right, and you might see some ducks there. The trail continues on about 0.4 miles and soon reaches the parking area for the Bellevue Botanical Garden. Turn left on the wide concrete sidewalk that heads directly toward the Visitor Center and main garden entrance. Admission is free, but note that if you're traveling with a dog, you'll have to save this for another day -- pups are not allowed in the botanic garden.A detailed map of the formal part of the Botanical Garden is available at the Visitor Center, and copies often can be picked up on an outdoor table near the southern edge of the center.Near the Visitor Center, you will begin the second loop (about a mile) of your hike. Head south on the pathway bordered by white railings. Turn right at the first opportunity and meander past a large bronze toad christened \"Goldiwarts,\" who quietly solicits (optional) donations via a slot in a sculpted log. Smile, and continue on through the Rock Garden (an exhibit of plants that do well in rocky habitats) and the Waterwise Garden (an exhibit of plants that do well with little watering.) Then, pass the Short House (donated by the Short family, who resided and farmed here in the 1950s.) Head southwest down the stairs and come to a wide trail that heads southeast. At a Y, take a hard right turn where the sign indicates \"Ravine Experience - Lost Meadow Trail.\" The Lost Meadow turns out to be a rather small grassy area. Continue on and pass a signed service road and, a few feet beyond that, turn right on the unsigned but obvious trail heading downhill. This leads, surprisingly, to a high cable bridge that carries the trail across a deep ravine. As you walk across, the bridge responds with slight bounces that enhance the already-airy feeling. Appreciate this high perspective on the forest and land forms.Once across the bridge, turn right. Farther along, next to a Stellers Jay sign, turn left. Along the way, be alert for any gnomes as this short loop leads you back to the bridge.Cross back over the bridge, turn right and then, at the gravel trail, turn right again. Soon, the Native Plant Garden appears on your left and, shortly after that, the Yao Garden on your right. Both are well worth a leisurely walk-through or a short contemplative rest on a bench. Then, the trail continues on past the Rhododendron Garden, in the spring offering an exuberant flourish of diverse colors. And, beyond that, you return to the Visitor Center, completing your second loop. From there, you can return to the parking area via the connecting trail.While you are in the formal part of the garden, you will note many plants are numbered, and there are frequent pads you can tap or scan with a smartphone for more information. Additionally, along the forest trails be alert in early spring for trilliums, and later in the spring for buttercups, fringe cup, avens, wild berries and salal. It's likely you will hear many bird calls, and see a few squirrels. Also, it is not unusual to see a few small rabbits here, although they may not be native to the park.","driving_directions":"From I-405 in Bellevue, take Exit 13 (NE 8th St) and head east.

(In the spring of 2015, residents voted to allow annexation by Sammamish.) In recent years, large homes and townhouses have been built in the area but the lake and a surrounding wide, forested buffer strip have been maintained as an urban wildlife sanctuary.A graveled loop trail threads through the forest of the buffer strip and a single dock juts out into the water for an extended view. The buffer strip is wide enough that occasional views of homes through the trees do not seem intrusive. The buffer strip contains some large trees, both coniferous and deciduous, particularly around the eastern side of the lake.The loop trail is only a mile and a quarter long, with less than 20 feet of elevation change. (whew!) The western shore offers occasional views across the lake toward Tiger Mountain.In spring, yellow-flowering water lilies bloom around much of the lake shore, and likely are the original inspiration for Yellow Lake's name.From the parking area, head northwest on the obvious path between the two buildings and cross a small footbridge to reach Klahanie Park. Head right past the playground equipment to find the trailhead for the loop trail. A portable toilet is available near the trailhead.At the trailhead, for the best view of the lake, take the right trail fork. It leads to the dock, which is the only viewpoint from which the entire lake can be seen. The surrounding homes are hidden by the trees, and the view across the lake gives the illusion of being in a more remote location. You are likely to see a few ducks and gulls on the water here, depending on the season.As you continue around on the loop trail you may see or hear woodpeckers and other birds in the forest. A few wildflowers may be out, particularly in the spring. Sets of exercise bars and platforms have been set up at several locations along the loop trail, and signs there suggest optional exercises. So this otherwise-gentle hike can become more strenuous if you like.At various points around the loop, signed side trails lead out to different parts of the Klahanie neighborhood, and any of these trails could be explored as hike extensions. A map of the Klahanie neighborhood and Yellow Lake is available via the link to the left of the map below. The map covers the entire neighborhood, so don't be discouraged by the large number of home sites and the apparent small size of the lake.","driving_directions":"From I-90 in Issaquah, take Exit 17 (Front Street) and head north as Front Street becomes E.

This makes an excellent outing, whether you want a quick jaunt or a longer bike ride, though the trail is in varying stages of development, so be sure you are prepared for pavement, gravel, or possibly dirt, depending on your route. Access is available for hikers, runners, and bikers from the Pe Ell entrance, in Chehalis, or off Dieckman Road, Ceres Hill, or Meskill Road, all near Adna. You can also hop on the trail from Rainbow Falls State Park, where you can ride or walk a short distance from the park's entrance to the trail itself. Find the paved section between Chehalis and Bunker Creek. This 5.5 mile stretch sees the most traffic of this trail. From there, the trail becomes graveled, perfect for bicycles with thick tires. As you walk, keep an eye out for equestrians. In addition to hikers and bikers, horses enjoy this trail from the Adna trailhead, found off Dieckman Road. Equestrians can also access the trail from Pe Ell; a Discover Pass is required for both of these trailheads. Though the trail runs 56 miles from Chehalis to South Bend, currently it can only be hiked in sections due to its incomplete nature. Several trestle bridges are closed due to a lack of decking, making them unsafe for travelers. Check out a helpful map of mileposts, closures, and notable sights along the way here: bit.ly/1RDKfLGAnother map illustrating which sections are best for hiking can be found here: bit.ly/1JpPqfUAs of December 2015, trestles at Spooner Road and Doty-Dryad Road have opened. This connects more than 12 miles of trail from Spooner Road west of Adna to Pe Ell.In June 2016, three more bridges have opened. While the bridge at mile 27 is still difficult to cross, this recent development allows visitors to enjoy an unbroken 27 miles of gravel, paved, and hard-packed dirt road.","driving_directions":"There are several access points for this trailhead.

It doesn’t even have an official name. Locally known as Z Lake, the area has gradually gained attention since being acquired by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and added to the 21,000-acre Swanson Lakes Wildlife Area. The area merges with the Bureau of Land Management Telford Recreation Area. One study pegged Z Lake as the most productive habitat for aquatic invertebrates in the region, luring walk-in anglers to cast for the few but plump trout. The management priority is protecting wildlife habitat, but cattle are still allowed to graze here—and they make most of the trails. Explore this area wearing sturdy boots.This hike can be done as an out-and-back from either the north or south trailhead. It’s described here as a one-way hike from the north trailhead, easily accomplished by leaving a vehicle or bicycle on Telford Road, just 1.5 miles along the road from your starting trailhead.Go through the gate and head west on Whittaker Lake Road (closed to unauthorized motor vehicles). At 0.5 mile, continue straight where the gravel portion of the road bends north. Soon, a bit of the long north–south ribbon of a lake will come into view below the basalt cliffs in the distance. This is a good point to pause with binoculars. Mule deer, coyotes, and other critters often can be seen taking cover when there’s movement on the horizon—including you.Continue down to a fence corner and go through the gate. There’s no defined trail at this point. Continue straight west, weaving through the mounds on game trails. Rugged boots are recommended for hiking because of the basalt scree that must be negotiated through the flats.Hike to the water and then turn south. It’s easy to find your own path along the east shore above the lake. Pass the old windmill tower and the solar panels that power the lake aerator, which helps provide oxygen for trout during the winter freezeup.A little farther south, an aluminum rowboat has traditionally been left for anglers to use. Check it out if it’s still there. Use it if you like, but bring it back off the water and turn it upside down with the oars inside—just as you should have found it.Soon you’ll come to the zigzag feature that gives the lake its name. Turn west and hike up into the rocky outcropping where the lake makes two right-angle turns. This is a great spot for a break and watching up and down the lake: look up for kestrels, marsh hawks, and opsreys; and look down to the water for waterfowl, turtles, and fish.Continue south along the shoreline. The walking gets easier. At the south end of the lake (can be wet in spring), eventually bend right to hit a ranch road. The way goes right briefly and dead ends at the lake.To finish the hike, continue south on the road. At an old corral area near some tall trees, follow the road as it bends left past a spring and eastward to the south trailhead and limited parking at Telford Road.","driving_directions":"From Davenport, drive 13.5 miles west on US Highway 2.

Enjoy the surrounding second growth forest, with its tall red alder and fir trees. Observe spring wildflowers or, seasonally, fall colors. And appreciate the sounds of a multitude of bird calls.This park has very few trail signs, and those just proclaim \"Trail.\" So a map is essential, even to follow the description below. You can download one from www.edmondswa.gov/yost-park-discovery.html. This same page offers an interesting history of the early days of Edmonds, and of early logging here.One trail shown on the map, the Songbird Trail just west of the parking area, seems not to exist (as of Spring 2016.) Also, as in any park, there are a few social trails not shown on the map. Please try to stay on the official trails.For a small park, the network of trails is surprisingly intricate. If you prefer, you can set out with the map and explore on your own. Or, here is a suggested route that gets to the most interesting parts of the park.From the NW end of the parking area, follow the gated park service road as it curves around to the right and heads toward the back of the pool. Be alert for the \"Trail\" sign on the left that marks the beginning of the Sword Fern Trail. Descend that trail steeply into the ravine, and reach a pair of bridges over Shell Creek. Note remnants of old concrete structures here, and elsewhere along the creek. They date from 1902 when the park's namesake, the Yost family, formed the Edmonds Spring Water Company to provide the first regular water service to Edmonds.At the creek, take the right trail fork (it's the Shell Creek Trail,) cross the bridge and follow the trail upstream. It's a good trail, partly on boardwalk. In spring, be alert for a few wildflowers such as buttercups, youth-on-age, avens, fringe cup and bleeding heart. Wild berries are found here too. Look for the early magenta blooms of salmonberry and later, the white blooms of thimbleberry and creeping raspberry. And, particularly in spring, listen for an ongoing medley of bird songs.Continue along Shell Creek Trail. It crosses the main stream twice and some minor tributaries as well on sturdy bridges. At a trail fork stay left (the right fork returns to the parking area.) Cross Shell Creek again on a bridge and turn right at the next trail crossing. At the next fork stay right and cross the creek again. Just before another bridge across Shell Creek, near the park boundary, note the Overlook Trail heading right and uphill.Take this trail, cross the park service road and climb steeply uphill. In May, near the hilltop, you are likely to see orange honeysuckle in bloom. At the top of the hill go straight. Drop slightly and, in about 100 feet, turn right onto the Crow's Nest Loop. In spite of the name, there is no view. Follow the trail a short way downhill and be alert for a trail on the left. Take it (the ongoing route ends near the tennis courts.) Soon, at a trail junction, head left again (the right fork also ends near the tennis courts.) Head back uphill and, at the now-familiar high point, go right on the Overlook Trail.Descend the Overlook Trail back to Shell Creek, cross the bridge near the edge of the park, and head gently uphill. The ongoing route can be somewhat confusing, because there are social trails as well as official trails along the way and, of course, there are no signs. It's likely you can refer to the map and follow the route along parts of the Cedar Loop Trail and the Highline Trail on your own. Or, refer to the following hints. (As a backup, any downhill trail will return you to the Shell Creek Trail.)At each of the next four trail junctions, stay right. After the last junction, you will be heading steeply uphill. Be alert for the trail that sweeps around to the left and take it. In a few feet go left again, then in a few more feet go right. At a trail crossing go straight. At a T-junction, go right on the Highline Trail. At the next trail fork, stay right. At the next T-junction, go left (the right fork leads out to a trailhead on Main St, opposite Olympic Ave.) This puts you back on the Sword Fern Trail, near its northern end.The route is easier now. Soon, look for a \"Trail\" sign pointing right. This is somewhat misleading, because it directs you to the Weir Trail that is a dead end. But do go there. The Weir Trail drops a bit and soon reaches Shell Creek at the site of another concrete structure. There are good views across the creek, and it's worth scanning the trees across the stream for pileated woodpeckers or eagles. When you are ready, head back up the Weir Trail to the Sword Fern Trail and turn right. Drop a few feet, and soon come to the dual bridges across Shell Creek that should look familiar. Continue straight ahead on the Sword Fern Trail to return to your trailhead at the parking area.Extending your hikeIf Yost Park hasn't satisfied all your hiking ambitions, Pine Ridge Park is only a half-mile away. You can easily hike over to Pine Ridge Park, enjoy some trails there (see our Hiking Guide entry for Pine Ridge Park) then return here. To get from Yost Park to Pine Ridge Park by foot, follow the park service road as it circles around behind the pool and heads toward the eastern park boundary. Continue straight ahead on Shell Valley Road. This is an area of suburban homes with a lot of green landscaping. It also has quiet streets with little traffic so it's generally a pleasant walk. In about 1000 feet, turn left on Pioneer Way. The street soon comes to a dead end, but a wide paved trail continues on. In another 400 feet it reaches Main Street, where it passes under the street via a tunnel/culvert. (Are you over six feet tall? If so, WATCH YOUR HEAD.) Beyond the tunnel, the trail enters a narrow extension of Pine Ridge Park, and you will find yourself on that park's Main Trail headed toward Cole's Cutoff. Refer to our Hiking Guide, and a Pine Ridge Park map, for additional details.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take Exit 179 and head west on 220th St SW. (Or, from SR 99 turn west onto 220th St SW.) At 92nd Ave W, turn right. In about 0.15 mile, turn left on Bowdoin Wy. In just over a quarter mile, before Bowdoin Wy bends left onto Walnut St, turn right into Yost Park. If instead you are approaching from downtown Edmonds, head east up the hill on Walnut St. In a few blocks, at 96th Ave W, the park entrance will be visible in front of you.Yost Park is open from dawn until dusk, and there is a large parking area adjacent to the swimming pool. Facilities are limited here. The map shows rest rooms near the pool, but they are accessible only when the pool is open (summer,) and they are signed for pool users only. A portable toilet at the NW corner of the parking area is accessible year round, but is signed for use by disabled folks only. Use your best judgment.If you are traveling by bus, Community Transit Route 116 runs along the northern edge of the park on Main Street. It has a stop at Olympic Ave, and you will find the northern end of the Sword Fern Trail immediately across Main St from Olympic Ave. If you are beginning your hike at this trailhead rather than at the parking area, consult the map for obvious route modifications.","distance":"1.5 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.808499908","longitude":"-122.360883951","elevation_gain":"220","highest_point":"360"},{"features":["Dogs allowed on leash","Old growth","Good for kids","Wildlife"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/olympic_peninsula.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//47.0285,-122.8891/@47.0285,-122.8891,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/20160310_093245.jpg/@@images/c7bb6bb8-d076-4e25-b491-4b7cd322002e.jpeg","region":"Olympic Peninsula","current_rating":"0.00 out of 5","name":"Watershed Park","trail_description":"Discover the area that was the original source of Olympia's drinking water--a delightful little green wetland known as Watershed Park. With thirty structures on the 1.35 mile loop, you can be sure to have an intimate look at the workings of a wetland without getting damp yourself.Originally the site of nearly all of Olympia's drinking water, this small park now provides a site of retreat for residents. The city operated the waterworks here, and relics are still visible if visitors look carefully. The area was saved in 1955 by the citizens who opposed a logging operation slated for Watershed Park. The park also boasts the source of Moxlie Creek. This spring, officially named Moxlie Creek Springs Basin, is one of the largest in the region. This accounts for the remarkable wetness in the area -- springs creep and flow around fragrant skunk cabbage and venerable mossy-limbed branches, making its way around and about to create Moxlie Creek. Beginning from the G. Eldon Marshall Parking area, descend steeply to the quiet creek, finding a sign lauding the people who were instrumental in saving this haven of nature in the city. Hiking clockwise, the trail begins as a relatively flat one, meandering around and over roots and boggy areas. Where it is not made of wooden structures, the trail is graveled or dirt, but with one or two steep, narrow sections, this is not a place for strollers or wheelchairs. However, those able to navigate a trail by themselves or with a little assistance will love how close to nature this trail brings them.

Cross over High Point Creek and, where the pavement ends, find the signed beginning of the High Point Trail. The trail loops around tiny High Point Pond and heads south, gaining about 200 feet in 0.3 miles before reaching a power line.A sign here indicates \"Lingering Trail,\" with a single arrow pointing south along the route. But you're still on the High Point Trail. The sign is there because this is the former location of a junction with the Lingering Trail. That trail has been rerouted, and you now will pass the junction 100 yards south of the power line. (The Lingering Trail is an option for your return hike.)Continue south on the High Point Trail about 0.4 miles, come to a signed junction with Dwight's Way, turn left and climb a few steps. Continue on Dwight's Way about 0.7 miles, crossing over the Lingering Trail.Dwight's Way has some gentle ups and downs with a net gain of about 100 feet. Along the way enjoy some of the nicest second-growth forest in the Tigers. Cross small streams on rustic bridges and, in one case, on a large log. Appreciate the exuberant growth of moss and ferns, and note occasional huge stumps, remnants from logging a century ago.Reach a signed junction with the Preston Trail (formerly the \"West Tiger No. 1 Trail,\" a name your Green Trails map still may use.) At this point, prepare for some uphill. You'll gain about 350 feet before the grade begins to level off.After 0.4 miles on the Preston Trail you might notice a faint trail merging with your route on your left, but you would be forgiven for thinking it's just another path where water runs off the trail. Actually, it's the route shown on your map as the Lower Bootleg Trail, a path that arrives here (via part of the Preston Trail) from near the D.O.T. Highway Facility on SE Preston Way. Also, it's part of a route by which a few mountain bikers access these trails, even though the trails officially are closed to bikers. You might not encounter bikers on your hike, but you could see tire tracks here, and along the ongoing Bootleg Trail if you return via that route.Continue on another 0.1 miles and come to a signed trail junction where the Middle Bootleg Trail heads off left. The ongoing Preston Trail, your route, climbs steeply uphill to the right. Gain about 500 feet in a half-mile, cross over a gently rounded knoll, and enjoy a brief stretch of downhill. But it's elevation you will have to gain back.At the low point, where the uphill resumes, note an old railroad grade heading left with a faint path visible along it. If you are here on a future hike and feel adventurous that's a path you could explore. It's rudimentary, but it does go through to join the Bootleg Trail. For today, just stay on the Preston Trail, climb another 100 feet and reach a signed trail junction where the West Tiger RR Grade arrives from Fred's Corner. By now you probably are thinking this hike has a lot of uphill. It does, and there's more. Stay on the Preston Trail and climb another 600 feet in a half-mile to reach a signed junction with the upper end of the Bootleg Trail. From here, the ongoing Preston Trail continues west below a ridge top. In 2014, the slope above the trail was clear-cut. Trees at the edge of the trail now are subject to the full force of storm winds, and there have been some blowdowns.As of early 2015, this part of the Preston Trail was completely blocked by a massive blowdown. (Check recent trip reports for the current status, and for any advice.) In less than a quarter-mile, come to a signed junction with the Poo Top Trail. Here, to reach the summit of W. Tiger No. 1 (or as close as an electronics tower will allow) you need to take a short side trip. Hike up the Poo Top Trail, gaining about 75 feet on four short switchbacks to reach a high point next to a large granite boulder. At 2948 feet, this is the second highest summit in the Tigers (only East Tiger, at 3004 feet, is higher.) It may seem somewhat anti-climactic, both because of the adjoining tower, and because there is no view. But don't despair! You soon will have your view. The Poo Top Trail continues on south to meet up with the Hidden Forest Trail, but that's for a different hike! For today, turn around and take the Poo Top Trail back down to the Preston Trail (from this side the sign says it's the Bypass Trail, because it bypasses the electronics.) Turn left and continue west on the Preston/Bypass Trail a quarter mile. Pass through some very dark forest and emerge abruptly into the bright sun (clouds permitting) at the Hiker's Hut Viewpoint.The hut itself is a small, round metal structure that might serve as a very basic storm shelter in winter. A graveled service road arrives here from the west to reach the electronics gear, and a bench is available across the road. Sit and take in the view. On a clear day, Mt. Rainier will be directly in front of you and of a large swath of the Olympics will be visible to your right. While you are at the viewpoint, you may be visited by a few gray jays. Humming birds also often are seen here and, in summer, large dragon flies. In spring, check the surroundings for wildflowers such as lupine and tiger lily (a few years ago tiger lilies bloomed right under the bench!)When you have had your fill of the view, and finished your lunch, it's time to think of returning. Either return the way you came, possibly taking the optional Lingering Trail, or see below for another possibility.Extending your hike*As of Spring 2015, a sign at the upper end of the Bootleg Trail, at its junction with the Preston Trail, indicates the Bootleg Trail currently is closed due to \"Logging Hazard.*On your hike up to W. Tiger No. 1 you passed two ends of the Bootleg Trail, so it's an obvious option for your return hike that will add about a half-mile to your distance.If you decide to return that way then, when you reach the junction at the upper end of the Bootleg Trail, turn right, follow it a short distance below the ridge top, then begin to descend steeply. At the point where the trail steepens, another short trail arrives from the right. It just leads up to the ridge top service road. (If, in the future, you are hiking the Bootleg Trail in the uphill direction, be alert for this unsigned junction near the ridge top, and watch for a large red arrow painted on a tree trunk to indicate where the Bootleg Trail bends west.)Descend the Bootleg Trail another 0.6 miles and approach a junction with the Paw Print Connector. Above the junction you might notice, off to your right, a small fir tree that sports holiday decorations, even in summer. It's one of two (at least) such trees in the Tigers (another is along the TMT above Ruth's Cove.) It is not known who adds the decorations, or who sometimes removes them.Continue down the Bootleg Trail. Eventually, it reaches another old railroad grade and abruptly levels out. The trail may seem to go both directions along the railroad grade, but the left branch is your ongoing trail. The right branch used to be very indistinct, but in recent years it has enjoyed more traffic and become more visible. It connects with an old logging road that is shown on your Green Trails map.Beyond the railroad grade, cross the East Fork of Issaquah Creek. Generally, this is an easy crossing on stones although the water level can be higher after a recent heavy rain, or when snow is melting above. After the crossing, continue down the Bootleg Trail to reach its junction with the Preston Trail. Follow the Preston Trail back to Dwight's Way, and return to your trailhead.Optionally, along Dwight's Way, when you come to the crossing of the Lingering Trail you can turn right and take it back to rejoin the High Point Trail above the power line.","driving_directions":"From I-90, a few miles east of Issaquah, take Exit 20 (High Point) and turn south on 270th Ave SE. Just a few yards south of I-90, note a large, white gate on your left across SE 79th Street, signed \"Road Closed.\" Your hike will begin behind that gate so you need to look for roadside parking immediately (i.e., do NOT continue on to the usual parking lot 0.8 miles west.) Here, as at many trailheads, occasional car break-ins have been reported. To minimize risk, try to park with both sides of your car visible from the road, and leave no valuables in your car.

The town was founded in 1893 at the west portal of the Cascade Tunnel along the Great Northern Railway. The town included a train depot that was unfortunately destined to become the site of the deadliest avalanche in US history. On March 1, 1910, a passenger train and a mail train were stuck at the Wellington Depot waiting out a blizzard that had been raging for nine days. During the night, while most people were sleeping, an avalanche hit the trains and the station quickly sweeping everything about 150 feet downhill into the Tye River valley.  96 people were killed in the event. Only 23 survived. In October of 1910 Wellington was quietly renamed Tye to ease the fears of travelers who would forever associate the name Wellington with this tragic event.In the same month that the town was renamed work began on the snowsheds designed to protect the rails and passing trains from future avalanches. Some of these sheds are still standing today. Tye was abandoned in 1929 when the second Cascade Tunnel, which is still in use today, was completed negating the need for trains to pass through the town.To reach Wellington you will follow the original path of The Great Northern Railroad along what is now the eastern portion of the iron goat trail near Stevens Pass. Head east on the trail from the parking lot to see old foundations and the west entrance to the original Cascade Tunnel. Walk west from the parking lot to enter the snow sheds and reach the site of the 1910 avalanche.WTA Pro Tip: Gary Krist's 2008 book 'The White Cascade' chronicles the historic avalanche for anyone interested in more information on the history of this particular area.","driving_directions":"Just west of Stevens Pass Ski area turn north onto Tye Road, also known as the Old Cascade Highway.

First, the route will take you to Poo Poo Point, a knoll on a shoulder of West Tiger Mountain, for the view and perhaps to see paragliders launching into the sky. Then, you'll continue via a sequence of short trails to reach and traverse all three numbered summits of West Tiger Mountain before returning to your trailhead.From the High Point trailhead on Tradition Plateau, follow the wide graveled trail 0.1 mile south. Pass the signed turnoff to the West Tiger #3 Trail and the Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT,) and follow the wide trail around to the right. In 100 yards cross a small bridge and, 100 feet beyond that, turn left onto the signed Nook Trail.Follow the Nook Trail, at first gently uphill. The trees you pass here, heavily draped with moss, may seem to endow the forest with an ancient quality, but it's all regrowth. Here and there along your route, occasional remnants of huge stumps hint at the truly-ancient forest that once graced these slopes.Your route gradually becomes steeper. At 0.7 miles, take a sharp right turn onto the signed Talus Rocks Trail and, in another 0.25 miles, come to the Section Line Trail. Perversely, the sign there shows only an arrow pointing to the right (downhill, toward the High School Trail.) Ignore that arrow! Take a sharp turn left, uphill, onto the Section Line Trail. In a few feet, pass a sign proclaiming \"Unmaintained Trail,\" which just means that maintenance is done by volunteer crews.The first part of the Section Line Trail may not seem too steep, but that changes. Short sections of the trail are among the steepest in the Tigers. In 0.2 miles come to the first steep section. Beyond that, the grade eases just a bit then reaches another steep section passing around a rocky outcrop.In summer, as you hike parts of the trail where little sunlight reaches the forest floor, look for saprophyte plants such as Indian pipe, coral root and candy stick.Press on, and soon come to the West Tiger RR Grade. (The Section Line Trail continues on to the West Tiger #3 summit, and will provide your return route.) Turn right onto the RR Grade. Most of the grade is nearly level, so this is a chance to catch your breath. In the century since logging trains last puffed along the grade there have been some wash-outs and slides, so expect occasional downs and ups.In 0.3 miles, come to an unsigned trail fork. Take the right fork (the trail heading uphill to the left is the Seattle View Trail that connects with the TMT.)Over the next 1.3 miles, the West Tiger RR Grade traverses Many Creeks Valley, crossing a number of small creeks on bridges constructed in recent years. Some of the creeks are seasonal, others run all year. In summer, some parts of the trail may be overgrown. Come to a three-way trail junction. From the downhill side, the Poo Poo Point Trail arrives from the direction of Issaquah High School. The trail continuing on uphill is the One View Trail, and that will be your route AFTER you have visited Poo Poo Point.For now, continue on the level grade. It changes names, becoming the ongoing part of the Poo Poo Point Trail, and it will take you to the point in 0.5 miles. Soon, drop over 150 feet on switchbacks, then resume a gentle uphill climb to reach Poo Poo Point. (The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging.)Poo Poo Point lies on a shoulder of West Tiger Mountain, and a small knoll there is topped by a mast with a windsock. The knoll is only a few feet higher than the surrounding area, but it qualifies Poo Poo Point - if minimally - as one of West Tiger Mountain's summits. The point offers a great view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue's downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle's tallest buildings showing beyond. On a clear day, more distant mountains may be visible.If your timing is right you can enjoy watching paragliders launch into the sky from the steep northwestern face of the point. You also may see hikers at the point who have arrived there via the Chirico Trail.To continue, return to the three-way trail junction and turn right onto the One View Trail. It's mostly uphill, but with an occasional downhill section, including a significant drop into Fifteen Mile Gap (there, streams to your right flow into Fifteen Mile Creek and those to your left into Gleason Creek.) Beyond the Gap, a short climb brings you to a junction with the TMT.Turn right on the TMT and, in 0.1 mile, come to the sign for Larry's Crossing. There, turn left onto the Hidden Forest Trail (Sorry, the most interesting part of the forest is downhill to your right, but that's a different hike.) Follow the Hidden Forest Trail uphill, at first climbing steeply then leveling out. After 0.2 miles from the TMT, cross the Main Tiger Mountain Road (Road 4000,) one of several non-public service roads in the Tigers. Across the road, your trail continues with a new name. It becomes the Poo Top Trail, and follows a ridge leading toward West Tiger #1. As ridges often do, this one has some ups and downs, so accept that your route to West Tiger #1 will cross several false summits.After hiking 0.7 miles beyond the road you do reach the West Tiger #1 summit. It's next to a tower at 2948 feet, and is the second highest point in the Tigers, after East Tiger Mountain (3004 feet.) It's the highest point on your hike today. But it's forested, so you have to go a bit farther for the view.Drop a short distance down the north side of the ridge, on switchbacks, and reach the signed Preston / Bypass Trail. (Names change in the Tigers, and your map may show a different trail name.) Turn sharply left there and continue 0.1 mile through dark forest to reach the Hikers Hut Viewpoint. (The hut itself is a small domed metal structure that might serve as a rudimentary shelter in winter.) Emerge abruptly from the dark forest into the open air and bright sunlight (clouds permitting,) and take a seat on the bench facing Mount Rainier. A swath of the Olympics may be visible too, from Mt. Ellinor at the south end to Mt. Constance as far as you can see around to the north.In season, look for lupine and tall white daisies and, occasionally, tiger lilies. As you sit, you are likely to see humming birds and large dragonflies, and are almost certain to be visited by two or three gray jays hoping to beg a lunch offering. It's a good stopping point, so stay a while and enjoy the view.When you are ready to continue, hike down the service road, dropping 400 feet. Come to a gate adorned with crude metal lettering \"No Trespassing.\" That's just meant to discourage unauthorized vehicles, and hikers are welcome to proceed via a trail around the right end of the gate.Continue on the service road, gaining 250 feet, to reach the West Tiger #2 summit. It you are seeking the highest accessible point, take the one minute side trip from the road up to the tower fence and the summit sign. There is not much of a view.Then return to the road and take the signed trail 0.4 miles on to the West Tiger #3 summit, crossing the TMT along the way. There often is a small crowd at West Tiger #3, and folks of all abilities hike to that summit from the north side. A few may have struggled to get there, so it's probably politic not to reveal that it's your fourth summit of the day.Now it's time to descend back to the lowlands. Take the wide trail that leaves the summit toward the northwest. As the trail begins to level out, about 200 feet from the summit, be alert for an unsigned trail heading downhill to your left. That's the upper end of the Section Line Trail. As confirmation, a few feet down the trail come to one of those signs announcing \"Unmaintained Trail.\"The footing on the Section Line Trail is not too bad when the trail is slightly moist. But when the trail dries out in summer it becomes gritty, and the small pebbles tend to roll beneath your boots. So watch your step, particularly in the steeper places. Trekking poles are advisable here.Cross over the intersection with the West Tiger RR Grade, completing your loop, and continue on down the Section Line Trail another 0.5 miles. Be alert for the sharp right turn onto the Talus Rocks Trail and, a quarter mile later, for the sharp left turn onto the Nook Trail. Failure to make these turns could take you well out of your way.Once you are back on the Nook Trail, it's an easy descent to Tradition Plateau, where a right turn on that wide graveled trail will take you back to your trailhead.WTA Pro-Tip: The four-summit hike can be done from the High Point Trailhead as described above. Alternatively, with minor variations, your hike can begin and end with the High School Trail, or with the Chirico Trail. Each option takes you to the same four summits in the same order, and includes the West Tiger RR Grade. Check the Green Trails Map 204S and, for additional details, refer to the hike descriptions for the Poo Poo Point hike, or the Poo Poo Point - Chirico Trail hike.Directions via the High School Trail: Park south of Issaquah High School and take the High School Trail to the lower end of the Section Line Trail. Hike the Section Line Trail, passing the intersection with the Talus Rocks Trail, and continue on to the West Tiger RR Grade. Proceed as above. On your return from West Tiger #3, take the Section Line Trail all the way down to the High School Trail, and return to your trailhead.Directions via the Chirico Trail: Park at the paraglider landing field next to Issaquah-Hobart Road and hike the Chirico Trail to Poo Poo Point. Take the Poo Poo Point trail to the three-way trail junction and turn right onto the One View Trail. Proceed as above. On your return from West Tiger #3, descend the Section Line Trail as far as the West Tiger RR Grade, turn left and follow the grade back to the three-way trail junction. Continue on to Poo Poo Point, and return to your trailhead via the Chirico Trail.","driving_directions":"From I-90, a few miles east of Issaquah, take Exit 20 (High Point.)

In anticipation of creating a more formal trail, PacifiCorp has repaired all the washouts with new culverts and fill in preparation for construction of the trail and associated facilities in 2017.The trail provides easy walking on mostly intact asphalt on the only public foot access to the east shore of Yale Reservoir. Streams plunge down from the steep ridge above the trail in cascades of waterfalls reminiscent of the many side streams in the Columbia River Gorge. Hikers will also enjoy views across the nearly 4,000 acre lake.

Located in the Mount Baker Wilderness, the trail traverses the south-facing slopes of the High Divide. As you climb, you are treated to spectacular wildflowers shows in spring and early summer. Come autumn, the hillsides are vivid in orange, reds and yellows. This is a breathtaking area at any time of year, and so understandably popular. Expect plenty of company on trail and arrive early if you plan on camping. From the trailhead, the trail begins and immediate ascent. You will share the trail with hikers bound for Tomyhoi Lake on this steep ascent, which gains nearly 1500 feet of elevation in just under a mile and a half. As the trail climbs, you switchback through an avalanche path (meaning this is a trail best done when snow-free) and enter a forest before popping out into a meadow. Fortunately, along the way various flora keep you occupied. Try and identify the trees in the woods as you trek along, and in the meadow, look for Indian paintbrush, lupine, heather and fireweed, among others. Bringing a field guide is a good idea; with it, you can take breaks and identify interesting trailside trees and blooms. For the more geologically inclined, rock formations carved out as the Puget Lobe retreated north provide equally fascinating distraction. And for photo buffs, there are of course the stunning views of  Mounts Baker and Larrabee, the western section of the High Divide, and, in Canada, the Border Peaks.Soon you reach the junction for Yellow Aster Butte – a mile and a half from the trailhead. Your destination is to the left. Heading right follows a trail to Tomyhoi Lake, another 2.5 miles away. The trail to Yellow Aster Butte flattens out some on this next section, as you traverse around the south flank of the mountain. You can breathe easy and take in the views all around you for a little more than two miles, until reaching an unsigned junction 3.6 miles from the trailhead.Backpackers may want to ditch heavy packs at camp. If so, head left. This trail descends on narrow, steep switchbacks to the camping area. Day hikers will want to head right, to the summit of Yellow Aster Butte. From here, the views are stunning, with Baker, Shuksan, Tomyhoi, and many other jagged, snow-covered peaks lining your horizon.

Instead, a scenic trail ambles peacefully through rolling alpine meadows blanketing the broad shoulder of Sahale Mountain. This park-like setting is made all the more spectacular by contrast with the dramatic mountainous terrain that stretches off in every direction near and far. Begin by following the Cascade Pass trail. From Cascade Pass, the trail heads north (left when arriving at the pass) and switchbacks its way up a steep slope. In early summer, it is a sea of glacier lilies; in fall, it is covered in mountain blueberries. In amongst the shrubs and wildflowers here, a population of marmots-unofficial ambassadors of Sahale Arm–begin a welcome that continues for much of the hike. Lumbering through the meadows, they seem not only unconcerned by the hikers passing through, but intent on entertaining them. Approximately three quarters of a mile from Cascade Pass, the trail crests a rounded shoulder at 6,000 feet in elevation and emerges suddenly to an awesome sight: Sahale Mountain and its eponymous glacier. Shimmering silver ribbons of meltwater snake their way down the precipitous slopes of the mountain some 3,000 feet to Doubtful Lake, tucked just out of sight. The trail heads left, offering peeks at Doubtful Lake below. The next fifth of a mile is mostly flat, a gentle stroll through heather before turning right towards Sahale Mountain. Though seeming to make its way gradually through small groves of trees, the trail climbs quite steeply around the bend before once again attaining the ridge. To the left, views open up to the unforgiving terrain of Boston Basin. Peaks with names like “Forbidden” and “Torment” tower above the Quien Sabe (“Who Knows”) Glacier. Further off in the distance, Mount Baker, Shuksan and Eldorado dot the skyline. After another half mile, the trail once again levels out as it passes the occasional tarn and outcroppings of granite set amongst windblown grass. You could be forgiven for feeling as if you’ve been transplanted to the Scottish Highlands. Enjoy this section while it lasts. In another fifth of a mile, the trail pitches upward again through a rutted, muddy section along a quietly cascading stream. The trail doesn’t let up again until it reaches the Sahale Glacier Camp, a collection of flat spots ringed with rocks piled up against the wind. The final half mile climbs sharply over scree and rock.Some of the campsites sit on the very edge of the terminal moraine of the glacier. The views are simply amazing. From here, you can see beyond the peaks of Cascade Pass to an endless procession of mountains such as Formidable and Spider. To the east, Sahale connects to Buckner Mountain, and beyond sit Storm King and Goode, the tallest summit in North Cascades National Park. In fall, Sahale Arm itself is the best part of the vista, as the meadows turn a brilliant shade of rust-red. As if there weren’t enough to draw you here already, Sahale Arm is also a reliable place to spot bear. An impressively large black bear with a glossy coat has been repeatedly spotted meandering across Sahale Arm and occasionally down to Cascade Pass. The bear knows what many a hiker does as well: of all the many incredible places in the North Cascades, this may very well be the finest to wander through. WTA Pro Tip: Camping in the Sahale Glacier Camp requires a backcountry permit, available on a first-come, first-served basis at the ranger station in Marblemount.","driving_directions":"Drive Hwy 20 to the little town of Marblemount.

As the name suggests, it passes through some areas that often are moist and have a prolific growth of ferns. Also, it passes tiny, aptly-named Round Lake, whose level fluctuates from year to year, and with the seasons.The trail is one of several in the Tigers that do not have a trailhead of their own, so it only can be hiked in combination with other trails. Because the network of trails on the Tradition Plateau is fairly complex, it will be helpful to refer to the Green Trails Map, No 204S, and it will be clear from the map that there are several options for a loop hike that includes the Wetlands Trail.Many hikers will find our Tradition Lake Loop a particularly satisfying route. It leaves the main High Point Trailhead and takes the Around the Lake Trail and the Bus Trail to reach the Wetlands Trail.As you hike the Wetlands Trail, please respect the signs marking some unofficial side-trails as \"Closed,\" and urging you to stay on the main trail to protect fragile wetlands.Once you have hiked the Wetlands Trail, the route continues on via the Brink Trail (briefly,) the Big Tree Trail and the Swamp Trail to return to the main trailhead. For important details, check the WTA Hiking Guide for the Tradition Lake Loop.Other routes leaving the main High Point Trailhead that include the Wetlands Trail will be evident from the map. Or, for a completely different hike, park near Issaquah High School and begin on the High School Trail. For more info, check the WTA Hiking Guide for the Poo Poo Point Trail that begins the same way. Before the High School Trail reaches the power line, you will note a sign on the left for the Adventure Trail, and that will be your return route. Continue on the High School Trail until you reach the power line, then take the Bonneville Trail 0.3 miles north along the power line to find the southeast end of the Wetlands Trail. Hike the Wetlands Trail, and when you reach a sign for the Adventure Trail take that trail back to the High School trail and return to your trailhead. NOTE: A copy of the Green Trails map is posted on the bulletin board at the Main Highpoint Trailhead and another is posted at the southeast end of the Wetlands Trail. You can refer to these maps if your own copy is buried deep in your day pack. The names and locations of Tradition Plateau trails shown on the Green Trails map correspond most closely with what you will find on signs placed along the trails.","driving_directions":"From I-90, a few miles east of Issaquah, take Exit 20 (High Point) and turn south on 270th Ave SE.

If you are willing to drive an addition 30 minutes east from the pass, Rachel Lake offers a spectacular, relatively quiet alpine hike. From Rachel Lake you can access further adventures at Rampart Lake, Lila Lake and Alta Peak. This hike is a popular weekend overnight destination; so don’t expect to be by yourself in high season. The trail starts off heading uphill before you cross into the wilderness boundary. Some roots and rocks will be present, but it's just enough to get you warmed up. Once you cross the boundary into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the trail grade eases. You will cross numerous small feeder streams as you wind your way up a box canyon. The trail alternates between sections of old-growth, primarily douglas fir and hemlock, and brushy avalanche meadows, where the trail is crowded by salmonberry, saw-ferns and devil's club. If you hike this section after an overnight rain or a dewy morning, prepare to get your legs more than a little damp.Two and three quarters of a mile in, the trail changes character. Cross Canyon Creek, the main stream you have been following up the valley and begin the earnest climb up to Rachel Lake. This section of trail is heavily rooted, with many large step-ups; to call it a trail is being generous. Though you travel only a mile, you'll gain 1200 vertical feet in this section. As you climb, you'll find distraction as you cross under a beautiful cascade where one of the many small streams cascades down a rock wall above you. Halfway up, you'll start getting great views back down Box Canyon. There are a number of false trails along the way, most of which have been blocked off with crossed sticks. Consult your map often and take heart; it will all be worth it when you top out at Rachel.There are a number of campsites at the lake. Bearing right, the trail skirts the lake and then heads up an additional 600 vertical feet to Rampart Ridge. By comparison to what you just hiked, this section is in excellent shape--well constructed with switchbacks and no big step ups. There  are fabulous views from this trail back down on Rachel Lake. Half a mile gets you to the ridge where you can go left 1 mile to Rampart Lakes, or right three-quarters of a mile to Lila Lake and Alta Peak. There is a sign, but it is set back a bit from the trail in an area that looks like a campsite. If you only have time for one add on, go to Rampart Lakes.

From here, head up the hill and in about half a mile, go left at the sign for Lost Lake. The trail is a connection of overgrown roads, climbing through forest in various states of re-growth. Some deep and dark, others more open, with partial views to Mount Baker. Signs lead the way to Raptor Ridge Trail, about 3.5 miles from Arroyo Park. The forest here is almost cave-like, it's so dense (and seemingly always cold), an impression that's enhanced by huge boulders and overhanging rock faces. Shortly, however, the trail opens up revealing a 180-degree awe-inspiring vista high atop a rock cliff. It's a terrific lunch spot. Various hawks next in the area and eagles are often spotted flying overhead, hence the trail's name. Nearby, it's possible to connect with trails leading to Pine and Cedar Lakes, Lost Lake, and the Madrone Crest Trail. WTA Pro Tip: Don't forget your map! While the trails are well signed on Chuckanut, having a map to consult will not only help you see how far you've gone, but you can put together countless loops as well.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take exit 250 to Fairhaven Parkway, a left if northbound or a right if southbound.

Follow signs to arrive at the Trail of the Shadows, a short, informative loop trail that begins your trek. After a short amble through enormous trees and swampy areas full of skunk cabbage and horsetails, you’ll arrive at a junction where the Trail of the Shadows rolls out in front of you, and the Rampart Ridge trail begins switchbacking upwards to your left. Take the left trail, and begin the steady, somewhat steep climb up. The trail is well-made, but the moderately steep grade may slow you down a bit. That’s OK – take the time to look all around you at the forest as the trail brings your eye level from the base, to higher and higher on the trunks of the trees. There are several interesting spots to stop for photos, including a fascinating wooden arch; a tree that seems to be growing back into the ground.

With an elevation gain of 1806 feet in the first two miles, and another 372 feet in the next mile, this trail is perfect if you're in training. Balsamroot decorate the hillsides as you proceed up up up, but soon the relatively clear trail turns into a route-find through downed trees, felled from beetle kill and old burns. Expect to scramble over more than a few blowdowns on your way to the top. The Rattlesnake Ridge trailhead is just off the Tucannon River Road, two miles past the Tucannon Guard Station. There’s no parking area as such, so your best bet is to have a Discover Pass to park in the Camp Wooten lot opposite the trailhead. Another option would be to stay at the Panjab campground, just 200 yards further down the road. In fact, the trail departs from the campground, so it’ll be right in your backyard. Begin by fording the Tucannon River, which rushes by the campground. The most well-established path to the water leads to a flat spot where the river passes over a small underwater berm of rocks. It’s 3 to 4 feet deep in high water, and 15 feet to the other side of the water here. The rocks underfoot are slippery. Keep this in mind when fording. If you’d rather not start the hike wet, you can brushbash upstream to a tangle of trees that, with a little acrobatics, you can cross without too much trouble. The trick here is getting back downstream to that ford. Watch your footing – a small user trail has been established but parts of it are very close to the water. Once you’ve arrived at the other side of the ford, the fun really begins. Immediately begin climbing steeply up the hillside, switchbacking through huge ponderosa pines, and whippy willows. WTA crews cleared the first mile of this trail in 2016 – this first part gives you a glimpse of what the trail could be like compared with the rest of the trail, which is slumping at best, at worst, it's hard to find due to blowdowns. The trail curves to the west side of the ridge, where balsamroot bask in the sun on the hillside. Keep climbing, and look also for lupine, paintbrush, desert parsley, and bitterroot as you go. Cross back to the east side of the ridgeline about a mile and a half from the trailhead, at your first peak -- 4776 feet. Here the trail becomes fainter, and many downed trees slow your pace. But you’re chugging upwards, and a pause now and then to figure out how to get around these knotted trees might be welcome. Skirt another outcropping masquerading as your second high point. Now begins your first traverse – just below the top of a ridgeline looking southeast. The trail here is narrow and crowded with brush. Watch your footing. After a bit of a breather, you’ll resume climbing, but this time a little more gently, to a broad open meadow, the intro to the second high point at 5748 feet. Skirt a small island of trees that shelters the high point, and follow the trail as it passes west to a point where it abruptly turns northeast and begins descending into a saddle. During this section, you may hear Alnus Spring burbling away, though it is out of sight, downhill from the trail. The saddle is an old burn area with other trees struck by beetle blight – lots of them are down and climbing over them takes some time. From the lowest point in the saddle, the trail begins to climb slightly as you follow a drainage (this is actually the trail, but water taking the path of a least resistance over the years has gutted it). Just as the brush and tree remnants seem to completely overwhelm the trail, pop out into yet another large meadow, and turn right. Trees are down (surprise) across the trail, but it just follows the forest border. Do the same, and soon see the trail turn away from the woods into the meadow. Join up with the trail and gradually hike uphill, past Red Fir Spring. Past the spring, parkland opens up and glades of forest dot the landscape which is primarily wide open meadows full of Jacob’s shooting star, glacier lilies, and myriad other vibrant wildflower. Snow stays here for much longer, so the trail may be wet as the water runs off. But the traverse is gorgeous, with beautiful wildflowers and views of the Blue Mountains beyond. Rattlesnake Ridge trail terminates about five miles from the trailhead, at an intersection in a meadow known as Indian Corrall. Taking a sharp right puts you on the 5.6 mille Panjab trail, which you can do in conjunction with Rattlesnake for a semi-loop (it requires a three mile road walk back to the Rattlesnake trailhead. Continuing straight on at this junction is the Misery Ridge Trail, and a slight right leads to the Crooked Creek trail. If you're just hiking for the day, turn around here or continue down the Panjab Trail. If you're continuing on, best of luck in your further adventures!","driving_directions":"From Highway 12 13 miles north of Dayton or about 23 miles west of Pomeroy, turn south on the Tucannon River Road.

A short, steep trail leads to the functioning fire lookout as well as magnificent 360 degree views of the Stuart Range, Teanaway Ridge, Chelan and Entiat Mountains, Mount Rainier, and even Mount Adams on a clear day.Start your hike from the parking lot, continuing up the dirt road. Spot Red Top Lookout perched on Teanaway Ridge above you, and continue up the path and over a dirt mound to the trail ahead. Enter a shaded forest and come upon a sign for the Teanaway Ridge Trail. Turn left here and start your 0.5 mile climb to the lookout.  The trail is steep, but short and easy to follow. Catch your breath by admiring the variety of wildflowers lining the trail such as the tiny white flowers of the common yarrow and the pretty purple petals of the aster. Look up to Mount Rainier as it slowly peeks out from the southwest.  Breaking out of the forest, you soon reach an exposed, rocky ridge and Red Top Lookout. The Stuart Range and Teanaway Ridge spread before you to the north, the Chelan and Entiat Mountains to the northeast, and South Cle Elum, Mount Adams and Mount Rainier to the southwest. Spot a large solar panel to the immediate north of the lookout. The panel powers a radio repeater that transmits radio signals over the rugged terrain.If the lookout is open, take the time to examine the many resources inside. Take a look at the panoramic map nailed on one of the walls and see how many peaks you can identify. Check out the large, compass-like device in the center of the lookout called an Osbourne Firefinder. This tool helps lookout volunteers pinpoint the location of a distant fire, which they can then relay to the Central Washington Interagency Communication Center. The lookout is typically staffed by volunteers in the summer months and is generally open to visitors from 9:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. It is locked if a volunteer is not there, so if you'd like to look around inside, try to time your visit for a summer weekend when a volunteer is more likely to be there. You can walk a bit beyond the lookout on a short ridge about 50 feet long for further views. This section, and the area surrounding the lookout is surrounded by steep dropoffs and rocks that are easy to slip on; exercise caution with children and those who might need a helping hand.Extending your Hike: Make it a loop! Instead of descending back the way you came, hike north from the lookout towards the big rock at the end of the ridge. Bear right at a fork in the trail and continue down the switchbacks. The trail continues to descend steeply, and in about 0.2 miles arrive at a junction with a sign marked Teanaway Ridge Trail 1364 nailed to a tree. Turn right to head back to the parking lot. The trail here is gently rolling with a couple of narrow, rocky sections and steep drop-offs; so exercise caution. This route is slightly longer than the 0.5 mile route, clocking in at about 0.65 miles, meaning the loop is about 1.05 miles total. WTA Pro Tip: Red Top Lookout and the trail to it is a popular place to find agates and thunder eggs. Starting at the trailhead, continue up the dirt road for about 0.2 miles, until you reach the Teanaway Ridge Trail sign. Turn right at the sign to reach the agate beds in one mile. There is a guide posted near the agate beds with helpful hints about the rock beds. As with wildflowers or anything else on trail, please refrain from taking these home in order to let future hikers discover these remarkable rocks as well.","driving_directions":"Heading east on I-90, take exit 85.

Now this beautiful wooded area is managed primarily as a nature preserve, with a focus on protecting its wide variety of habitats, including ponds and other wetlands. In the interest of protecting the quality of these habitats, the preserve has enacted the following rules: no pets, no alcohol, no fires or smoking, and no firearms. Please abide by these rules in order to keep the outdoor experience pleasant for all trail users. The park's trails are multi-use: popular for hikers, trail runners, mountain bikers, and horseback riders. Be prepared to share the trail and look out for horse droppings. An underground natural gas line and pipeline regional trail above it runs north to south through the middle of the park, and an overhead power line runs east to west. Several regional trails pass through the park. You can pick up a brochure -- which includes a trail map -- at the signboard near the parking lot. The park has more than seven miles of trails, but take note of which ones are open to which kind of users. The Trillium Trail on the west side of the park is for equestrians and hikers. Siler’s Mill Trail on the east side of the park is gated and for hikers only. Each of the trail intersections is signed and has a map letting you know where you are.

However, even if you don’t see any animals, this trail which used to be an old road is a perfect getaway year round.No journey to the Quinault rainforest is complete without at least hiking to Pony Bridge at the end of the Graves Creek road.Leading from the Graves Creek campground, the route to Pony Bridge crosses a total of three wooden bridges, each growing in beauty the further you trek into the Quinault Wilderness. In an area that receives over 14 feet of rain each year, nature reclaims everything at an expedited speed. As you venture further down the trail, the roar of the Quinault soon returns and the river comes into view. Within feet, Pony Bridge becomes visible, as does the impressive and wild box canyon thatit spans.Twenty-five feet above a narrow gorge, the waters of the Quinault hug moss-covered rock walls, flowing under towering trees. Sit along the fast moving current for a unique lunch spot. From here, the path leads to an exposed ledge, giving a fantastic view of the river and the bridge from a few hundred feet upstream.In the early spring, the river is running high and rough; making it the ideal time to see the area. In the late fall, salmon run up the narrow stream, struggling against the fast current.","driving_directions":"Travel north from Hoquiam on US 101 for 35 miles. Turn right at South Shore Road.

It's a touch longer than many day hikers want to tackle, and even most of the campers will drop off past Talapus, Ollalie, or Pratt, leaving you (and a few hardy others) to discover these alpine jewels. The first mile of trail will be busy on a weekend, but after passing a junction with the Granite Mountain trail, some of the crowds disperse – or at least spread out. Continue hiking along the wide Pratt Lake Trail, crossing several sweet streams fed by snowbanks high up on the flanks of Granite. In early spring, these stream crossings can be high, even treacherous, so evaluate each crossing for safety according to your own ability. Three miles in, you’ll come to a junction. The left-hand fork leads to the Ollalie Lake Trail in just 0.2 miles. Some hikers may duck down this trail, but press on! Climb a gentle grade, and within a third of a mile reach a clear spot in the trail. Here Ollalie Lake lies still and green in the valley below you, and Rainier hovers above. In this open area, beargrass flourishes in early spring. It’s a great spot for a snack and photo opportunity. After your snack, continue uphill to the Pratt Lake junction. The trail to your right leads to a large sapphire-like lake on the north side of the ridge you're on. To get to Island and Rainbow Lakes (which remind hikers more of emeralds), follow it to the left. You'll continue a further mile along the south slopes of Pratt Mountain to a high point. Here you're faced with a decision. Turn left off the main trail and descend 0.4 miles to Island Lake, or hang a right and drop a half mile to Rainbow Lake.Either location is a good one, and luckily a bootpath connects the two lakes, so you can visit both before heading back the way you came. WTA Pro Tip: You can also access Island and Rainbow Lakes via the Ira Spring Trail and Mason Lake, but parking is much more restricted from this end. Consider carpooling, or arranging a pickup/dropoff if you want to start from this end.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 47.

Though doable as a day hike, it is better enjoyed as an overnight destination, with nearby Alta Mountain and Lila Lake making excellent side trips.Start by following the trail to Rachel Lake, a 3.5 mile trail that gets increasingly steep and rugged as you get closer to the lake.  There are some waterfalls along the way to distract you from the trail, but the ratio of scenery to effort is low on this early section of the trail. It's a haul up to Rachel Lake, but once there, you'll be happy you took the time to do it.As you arrive at the lake, look for a trail on your right marked “Trail”, near the trail to the privy (marked “Toilet”). This trail heads north initially, and then turns west as it travels around the north side of the lake. Once you have located the trail, take a break for a few minutes to enjoy Rachel Lake. The lake is a worthy destination in its own right, with plenty of space to spread out and camp, swim, or just relax.  When you’re ready to continue climbing, head back to the trail signed “Trail”.  This rocky trail switchbacks steeply up to the ridge in just half a mile.  Along the way, you will enjoy periodic views of Rachel Lake.When you get to the ridge, you’ll see a trail off to your right, and then a few feet later a sign marking that trail. The trail to the right heads to Lila Lake and Alta Mountain. Lila Lake is more open and features distant views. A climber’s path to Alta Mountain branches off of the Lila Lake trail, and is even more rough and steep than what you have already experienced. But your destination is Rampart Lakes, so save the trail to Lila Lake and Alta Mountain for another time and turn left on the trail to Rampart Lakes.As you near Rampart Lakes, you’ll notice a maze of social trails. It can sometimes be difficult to tell which one to take. Look carefully at trail junctions; sometimes you will see a pile of rocks or sticks blocking a trail. This indicates a trail to avoid using.Following the main trail, you’ll encounter lots of berries, several lakes, a signed backcountry privy, and eventually the two largest lakes. You’ll probably also find plenty of people swimming, camping, and enjoying picnic lunches.  This environment is fragile and overused. To help keep it intact, be careful to stay on the trail or durable surfaces such as rock. If you’re staying overnight, take note that there is a back-country privy near the large lake, with signs pointing to it.WTA Pro Tip: If you’re backpacking, consider side trips to Lila Lake and Alta Mountain.","driving_directions":"From I-90 East, take exit 62.

You’ll get a view of the famed Rainbow Falls, traipse through a recovering burn area and have beautiful down-valley views of the head of Lake Chelan and the mouth of the Stehekin River. There are two trailheads for this hike, so it is less of a loop than a horseshoe, unless you access the trailhead using a bike and need to return to your starting point to reclaim your it. If this is your plan, start from the lower trailhead – there is more elevation gain on the hike itself, but more room to stash a bike. Point to point, this is a 4.4 mile hike either way, but adding the return trip makes it more than 8 miles if you’re hiking back from the upper trailhead. However, if you are relying on the shuttle bus, start at the upper trailhead, since it’s a much shorter walk back to the landing if you miss the shuttle at the end of your hike. Simply ask for a dropoff at the upper Rainbow Loop trailhead from the bus driver. To access the lower trailhead, proceed up the Stehekin Road a little less than a mile past the Stehekin Pastry Company (about three miles from the ferry landing). Look for a trailhead sign a few hundred feet back from the road with mileages for the Rainbow Loop and Rainbow Creek trails. You’ve arrived!Hop on the trail and almost immediately begin gaining elevation as you proceed east, paralleling Boulder Creek. The trail turns sharply away from the creek shortly after entering the 2010 Rainbow Bridge burn area. This fire was started by a lightning strike in a camp along the Rainbow Creek Trail and quickly spread to 3,635 acres, closing many of the trails on the east side of the valley and threatening structures on the valley floor. No structures or lives were lost, but several trails in this area, including the Rainbow Loop, now pass through sections of burns. Hike carefully as you pass through here, and watch for wind. If it becomes gusty, consider visiting another time. 1.7 miles from the lower trailhead, the Boulder Creek trail splits off, heading up along Boulder Creek and eventually looping back down to the landing area. That’s a multi-day excursion, however. Your trail continues off to the left.Continue traversing through the burn area, enjoying picture-perfect vistas of the head of the lake before reaching another junction 1.2 miles from the lower trailhead. This is the Rainbow Creek Trail. Another excellent multi-day hike option, Rainbow Creek is accessible from Highway 20 as well as Stehekin. This is also your high point, and from here, the trail descends 2.2 miles and 900 feet to the upper trailhead. Don’t miss the cheerful sign at this end with rainbow-painted letters. Snag a shuttle bus heading back to the landing from here, or turn left and head down the road. A local may offer you a ride to the landing, or if the bus comes by, you can usually flag them down for a ride. Just be sure to have cash with you for the $7 fare. WTA Pro Tip: The best way to hike this as a true loop is if you’re staying at Harlequin Campground. The mileage in this case is 6.6 miles round trip, if you walk to the lower trailhead from the campground and follow the directions offered in the description above to the upper trailhead.In almost any case, the Rainbow Loop is one you can only do if you’re overnighting in Stehekin, there’s just not enough time in the ferry schedule to do it without missing the last boat out.","driving_directions":"Travel to the town of Chelan and find your way to the Lady of the Lake ferry terminal. Ticket prices for the ferry vary depending on which ferry you take and what season you visit; check them at ladyofthelake.com. Once you're in Stehekin, make arrangements to get to either the upper or lower trailhead, depending on which way you've decided to go. The easiest way to do this is to take a bus, but if you want to stay on your own schedule, consider renting bikes from Discovery Bikes, just a few hundred yards up the road from the ferry landing.","distance":"4.4 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"48.3379134567","longitude":"-120.694090538","elevation_gain":"1000","highest_point":"2200"},

Just remember, what goes down, eventually has to come back up. After a steady descent for one mile, the trail levels out on the sloping flanks of Berry Mountain at a small lake and trail junction.

An ode to lifelong nature photographer and conservationist Ira Spring, this highly popular summer trail traverses steep pitches and open meadows en route to Mason Lake, a popular weekend camping destination in its own right. From the parking lot, the trail meanders through dense forest and gently climbs a few long switchbacks until reaching Mason Creek at 0.8 mile. Normally docile from late spring to fall, be aware that high water can occur in the spring. Luckily, thanks to the efforts of volunteer crews and the generosity of the Spring Trust for Trails, a sturdy footbridge has been installed across the creek, and hikers can safely cross it in all seasons. At 1.6 miles, veer left at an obvious but unmarked junction and take a deep breath -- the real climbing starts here. Ascending several steep pitches, the trail zigzags above tree line into an alpine meadow bursting with seasonal wildflowers and mountain vistas. Stay left at the junction with the Bandera Mountain Trail at 2.9 miles and continue climbing north toward the high point of the hike, a rocky crest at 4,320 feet. Here, expansive views to the south and west reveal prime photo opportunities and glimpses of Mount Rainier on clear days.Drop over the north side of the ridge into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, quickly descending about 300 feet to the shores of Mason Lake -- a small but deep alpine pool swimming with plump trout. The main trail continues along the west and north banks of the lake to several designated camping areas, complete with a backcountry privy. Find an unclaimed boulder on the shore and soak in sunlight while enjoying views of Bandera Mountain and its tree-lined slopes reflect off the cool waters. WTA Pro Tip: There are several ways you can lengthen your trip here.Option 1: From the junction with the Bandera Mountain Trail, head to the summit of Little Bandera Mountain -- a short but aggressive 0.6-mile jaunt to elevated lake views and sweeping northwest vistas. But don’t underestimate the effort required; from the turnoff, this narrow path soars 700 feet up the ridge spine in just over half of a mile.Option 2: From Mason Lake, follow the main trail along the north bank to the junction with Mount Defiance Trail. Turn left and follow this trail for 1.3 miles until reaching a spur trail to the summit at 5,200 feet. Views abound at the crest, but the 5,584-foot summit is a steep climb and scramble along the rough 0.2-mile spur trail.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive east on I-90 to exit 45.

The basin that cradles Indian Bar Camp may well be the home of the best wildflower fields in the park. The main camp is on a small ridge above the meadows, though an old stone shelter in the heart of the meadow marks the location of the group camp. It’s also worth noting that the single most spectacular backcountry toilet in the state is found here. Rather, the toilet itself is nothing fancy—just a lidded box, really—but the views from this “throne” include the whole of the wildflower meadows, the cascades tumbling down the cliffs at the head of the basin, and the crown of Mount Rainier above it all.The trail, a section of the Wonderland, leaves Box Canyon and provides a nice warmup over the first mile, climbing only a few hundred feet to reach Nickel Creek Camp. Here, though, the trail gets serious about its climbing. You ascend steeply for the next 2 miles to reach the crest of the Cowlitz Divide ridgeline and a junction with the Olallie Creek trail (Hike 42). Stay left and follow the ridge crest north as it climbs toward Mount Rainier.For nearly 4 miles you follow this ridgeline, staying atop the crest as it rolls through forests and broad meadows. You’ll find glorious views of Mount Rainier at times, as well as looks east across the Ohanapecosh Valley to Double Peak and Shriner Peak.At about 6.5 miles, the trail climbs above timberline and crosses an area of rock and permanent snowfield on the flank of Cowlitz Park before a final 800-foot descent into the basin of Indian Bar. The Ohanapecosh River flows through the heart of this meadow, and you can see this remarkable river being born out of the waterfalls tumbling down the rocky walls surrounding the basin. As you walk into the basin, you pass the pretty cascade of Wauhaukaupauken Falls before reaching the impressive stone shelter at the group site in the heart of the meadow (7.5 miles from the trailhead).

Renowned for being able to \"live in two worlds\" So-To-Lick was dubbed Indian Henry by a mail carrier unable (or unwilling) to learn his real name. He guided the likes of John Muir, George Bayley, James Longmire and Philemon van Trump up sections of the massive mountain, but never summited it himself. Like many Native Americans, he considered the mountain sacred, never venturing onto the glaciers as it may bring bad luck.The renowned guide has been memorialized for both his \"Boston\" name (Indian Henry) as well as his Native name. After So-To-Lick's death, van Trump named one of the many peaks that surround the hunting grounds after him: \"Satulick Mountain\". The tranquil meadows are accessible two ways, the Kautz Creek Trailhead near Longmire, and via the West Side Road. Overall, the trail that starts at the White River Road is kinder to your knees than the Kautz Creek access, though there are a couple of washouts that must be skirted by steep trail reroutes, and—with a two-mile road walk before the actual trailhead—this way is considerably longer.If you decide to explore Indian Henry’s Hunting Ground this way, park at the closure of the West Side Road and hike or bike up the road two miles. Wind your way through large boulders, which come down in spring avalanches, and cross two small creeks (one has a bridge, one does not). Carry on via a straightaway that parallels the river until the road bends around to the left, ascending into a green tunnel of trees. This crook is your departure point. Turn right off the road, onto a trail that is largely marked by cairns for the first section. It’s a short forest walk before popping into the riverbed, where you’ll follow a well-marked trail along the edge of the roaring torrent of Tahoma Creek. In spring, this can be quite high; check conditions before heading out. After a half-mile of riverside walking and cairn following, the trail turns left back into the forest. Ascending along the hillside, the trail soon arrives at the first washout. Marvel at the river’s power that took such a large chunk out of the trail, then begin the steep climb up and over. Once past this washout, the trail resumes a moderate uphill grade to the second washout, steeper than the first. Clamber up and over exposed roots and descend sharply back down. Be careful here.After conquering the two washouts, continue on, hiking along a gentle grade at first and then through some switchbacks leading up a ridge. At the top—1.5 miles in—is a sign indicating that you’ve joined the Wonderland Trail. Take the right-hand fork, heading east on the Wonderland before arriving at a suspension bridge spanning Tahoma Creek. Cross the bridge and chug on uphill on the other side. The trail maintains a steady grade for about two miles, leading you up hillsides, through green forest stocked with second-growth hemlocks and cedars, and stunning views of Rainier and the Tahoma Creek drainage and the glaciers that feed it. One final push up and over a ridge puts you in sloping meadows carpeted with huckleberries and laced by little creeks: a precursor to your final destination. Continue on, arriving at a trail junction in Indian Henry’s Hunting Ground, two and a half miles from where you joined the Wonderland Trail. From this junction there are plenty of options for exploration. Take the trail branching to the left to visit Mirror Lake, or continue straight on and arrive at the ranger’s cabin in about a quarter mile. From the cabin, rest up and imagine So-To-Lick living up here, hosting explorers and guiding them up the enormous mountain looming overhead. WTA Pro Tip: Make the trip a thru-hike by continuing on the Wonderland and following the Kautz Creek trail out. Of course, you’ll need to arrange a shuttle in order to do this route, but with the stunning wildflowers and views of Rainier, Adams, St. Helens, and the forests between spread out before you, it’s hard to turn around.","driving_directions":"From the Nisqually entrance of Mount Rainier National Park (off Highway 706), drive east on Nisqually-Longmire Road for 1 mile.

The town of Moncton was once a stop along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, also known as the Milwaukee Road. The town met its demise in 1915 when Masonry Dam was constructed on the hillside above to provide Seattle with power and water.

Along the way, enjoy a dense grove of cedars, followed by close-up views of blueberry fields that still produce an annual crop. Circle Larsen Lake, and view a restored pioneer home. Optionally, extend your hike to view nearby Phantom Lake.Because the park includes some side trails and route options, it will be helpful to refer to a trail map. A map is displayed on the bulletin board at the trailhead, but it's even better to have one in hand. You can check at the Ranger Station one block west, or can download a map from parkstrails.myparksandrecreation.com/Details.aspx?pid=467 (Click the link for \"Detailed map of Lake Hills Greenbelt Trails,\" not the link for \"Map/Directions.\") Find the trailhead at the east end of the main parking lot and follow the signs toward Larsen Lake. The initial surroundings may seem somewhat swampy and weedy, with a lot of blackberry bushes and some invasive bind weed. But things get better! You will come to a grove of cedars. It's rather dark, and is the only part of your hike that will feel like real forest. Beyond the forest, the route returns to more open country and soon passes a Little League playfield.Beyond the playfield, cross Lake Hills Blvd at the crosswalk (there is no stop light, and traffic moves quickly.) Soon, you will be passing rows of neatly planted blueberry bushes. The land here is leased for farming, and it still produces an annual crop of berries. In about 0.1 mile from Lake Hills Blvd, note a trail arriving from the west and signed \"148th Ave SE.\" That will be your return route after you circle Larsen Lake.For now, continue on another 0.1 mile or so, then turn left on the trail that heads west. (If, instead, you were to continue on straight ahead you would come to one of Bellevue's ubiquitous shopping malls. The mall trailhead is rather unglamorous, approached along a high mesh fence with a view of the back and side of a Walmart store. But hey! If you want to liven up your hike with a bit of shopping, or get a coffee, the mall does offer some options.)Once you have turned left, continue on west about 0.1 mile and take the short side trail to the left that leads out to a viewing platform that offers a fine view across Larsen Lake. Pause and enjoy it for a while. Then return to the main trail and continue west another 0.1 mile where the ongoing trail bends around toward the south. Continue on south to the obvious parking area next to two buildings.One building is the Larsen Lake Blueberry Farm produce stand. The other is a genuine pioneer home, originally built near Phantom Lake by Henry Thode, and relocated here and restored to ensure its preservation. Note the carefully hewn joints of the main timbers. Sign boards here offer interesting commentary about the early days of settlement, beginning in the 1880s when this part of Bellevue was mostly a wilderness.The south side of the Thode home now sports public restrooms that are open seasonally from May through September. The adjoining parking area is available for those who prefer to begin their hike at this corner of the park, or who just want to hike around Larsen Lake.Your ongoing trail heads back east, skirting additional blueberry fields, and it rejoins your incoming route at the junction noted above. Turn right at the junction and return to the main parking lot to complete your hike.EXTENDING YOUR HIKEFrom the parking lot, Lake Hills Greenbelt extends another half-mile to the southeast, and that section of the park offers one of the best publically accessible views of Phantom Lake. The round trip adds about 0.6 miles to your hike, and if your time and energy permit you really shouldn't miss it. At the intersection of SE 16th St and 156th Ave SE, cross both streets on the crosswalks and head south on the wide asphalt path that parallels 156th Ave SE. In about a quarter mile, take the side trail downhill to the left. Along the way, an interesting sign board tells how the lake levels have changed over time, in part due to excavations done in the 1890s by Henry Thode, whose relocated home you hiked past earlier.As you approach the lake, the trail forks. The right fork leads to a picnic table that offers only a minimal view across the lake, obscured by offshore cattails. But the left fork leads to a viewing platform that stretches out into Phantom Lake and offers a panoramic view around the lake. Stay a while and take it all in. Then head back toward 156th Ave SE, where you will find a restroom, some picnic tables and a small 10-car parking area. From there, return back north the way you came to reach the main parking lot.","driving_directions":"Unless you are in Bellevue already, take I-90, Exit 11B, and head north on 148th Ave SE. In about 1.25 mi, turn right onto SE 16th St. In about 0.4 miles be alert for a small sign on the left for Lake Hills Greenbelt. It's just BEFORE you reach the stop sign for 156 Ave SE. Turn left into the parking lot where there is room for about 30 cars. The trail begins along the east edge of the lot.If you are seeking a restroom stop first, they are located at the north end of the Ranger Station building. From the parking lot, head west past the covered picnic shelter and turn left (uphill) on the gravel path. At the Y you can go either way, but the left branch is shorter. Then return to the parking area and find your trailhead.If you are coming from farther north or west in Bellevue, take NE 8th St east to 148th Ave SE and turn right. Continue south to SE 16th St and turn left. Proceed as above.If you are traveling by bus, there is no route that stops near the main trailhead. But King County Metro Route 226 travels Lake Hills Blvd between 148th Ave SE and 156th Ave SE, and thus crosses Lake Hills Greenbelt midway between the main trailhead and Larsen Lake. This at least offers the option of first hiking around Larsen Lake, then hiking south to the main trailhead and back, or vice-versa. Alternatively, Route 245 has stops near the mall at 148th Ave SE and Main St, allowing access to the park from the trailhead behind Walmart.","distance":"2.3 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.5965559045","longitude":"-122.132177353","elevation_gain":"50","highest_point":"330"},{"features":["Wildflowers/Meadows","Mountain views","Dogs allowed on leash"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/eastern_washington.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//48.7027,-118.4665/@48.7027,-118.4665,11z/data=?hl=en","region":"Eastern Washington","current_rating":"0.00 out of 5","name":"Old Stagecoach Trail to Copper Butte","trail_description":"The Kettle Crest National Recreation Trail skirts seventeen peaks, but only goes directly over the top of Copper Butte, the sixth highest peak in eastern Washington.Access the summit and take in the fantastic scenery by starting at the Old Stagecoach Trail, the only remaining segment of Washington's first highway, constructed in 1892 and abandoned in 1898.

The rock cliffs which you will ascend extended out into the Columbia making a formidable barrier. This was removed in the '60s to make way for interstate 84. The wagon trail went up and over the notch between the lower and higher peaks. Think of this if you take the side trail to the lower peak. There is faint evidence of this old road bed going through the pass.The trail quickly begins to steepen and will mostly remain steep until the top. Switchbacks, loose uphill sections, talus fields to cross, and even a small grove of old growth Douglas Fir are in this short trail. For the most part the trail winds through trees and short rocky cliffs.Near the top, the trail exits the forest and passes under some power lines. In the spring and summer there can be nice wildflowers here. The trail now bends back towards the river and steepens again as it climbs the spine of the point. It's a wee bit exposed here be sure to mind your footing and keep your pet close at hand.

The park has over six miles of trails, with both wide-hard surfaced paths and more primitive dirt tracks. This loop hike combines both types to give you the optimum experience while exploring a lake, creek, and two waterfalls. There is also an optional side trip to visit the Lily Fields, which are infused with purple camas blossoms from mid-April to mid-May. Although there are some heart-thumping uphill sections, the hike is generally easy and appropriate for reasonably fit people of all ages. There is a labyrinth of trails in the park, and it’s easy to end up someplace you didn’t intend to go. Be sure to print a copy of these instructions and download a map or snap a photo of one at the trailhead. Keep in mind, though, that many of the trails do not show on the map.The hike begins at the southern end of the Round Lake picnic area. In about 0.3 miles, you will come to a screening device and a dam. The screening device was built to keep fish and debris out of the water supply for the paper mill, and the dam serves as Lacamas Creek’s outlet from the lake. Cross the screening device and then the dam, ignoring side trails to the right until after you cross the dam. After the dam, skip the primitive trail to the right and continue on to the second trail to the right. This 0.6 mile unmarked trail will take you to the Pothole Falls Overlook and then on to Lower Falls. When the water is low in the summer, Pothole Falls has some interesting geological features. You can see a pair of round pools and weirdly pockmarked bedrock. Floodwaters created the curving, smooth shapes by swirling rocks in depressions in the soft rock. After checking out Pothole Falls, return to the trail and continue downstream to Lower Falls. The trail follows the creek from the top of a ravine before dipping into a lightly forested area with small streams. The trail then rejoins Lacamas Creek where you are treated with the sights and sounds water cascading over rocks. Ignore side trails and keep on this trail until you come to a picturesque wooden bridge crossing the creek at the top of Lower Falls. Although this hike doesn’t include the bridge, it is worth taking some time to explore here. Cross the bridge to take in the falls from the top and perhaps stop at the picnic area on the west side of the creek for a snack. You may also want to take a side-trail downstream on the east side of the creek to experience the full impact of the water tumbling over the falls. After exploring the falls, return to the east side of the creek and go uphill on a wide hard-surfaced path. You will soon come to a junction with signs pointing to Round Lake and to an access road. Go towards Round Lake. You will then come to two dirt trails to the left. Skip the first one, and take the second one, which has a small marker indicating it goes to Round Lake. This 0.4 mile shortcut is much more peaceful than continuing on the main path. The trail enters a forest with bracken and sword ferns in the understory and cedar and vine maples overhead. Ignore side trails and stay on the main trail. When you come to another hard-surface trail, turn left to return to Round Lake. Along the way, you will see signs for the Camas Lily Fields loop on the right. If you would like explore the loop, turn right at the first sign. The 0.7 mile Lily Fields loop climbs up a hillside, then dips into and out of forested areas and meadows where the camas lilies blossoms are resplendent mid-April to mid-May. If you would like to skip the Lily Fields, continue on the hard-surface trail to the second sign for the Camas Lily Fields. Turn right for the scenic shortcut path to the Round Lake Loop Trail. You will come to a junction with the Round Lake Loop trail, which is also where the optional Lily Fields side trip ends. Turn right and follow the hard-surfaced trail 0.7 mile to the trailhead on 35th Avenue. The first section is a hilly up and down trek through the forest, but the second section is a peaceful walk through wetlands near the lake. When you get to 35th, turn left and return to your car.

The road is no longer open to visitor vehicles, and its easy grade as it climbs the 6.5 miles to the Cook's Cabin Heritage Area make it a good option for group and family hikes or bike rides.  With a trailhead at either end, it's easy to hike a portion of the full route or arrange a point-to-point hike with a shuttle vehicle.  The Lower Mount Kit Carson Loop Road trailhead begins from the hairpin turn at 3920 feet. The trail crosses portions of Burping Brook shortly inside the gated access. Visitors will find picnic tables tucked beneath giant cedars in three locations within the first mile, making short hikes and relaxing picnic dinners an inviting option. Just past the one-mile mark, the snowshoe hut at Smith Gap offers visitors a chance to get out of the elements year-round. The hut was constructed though generous grants and numerous private donations.  Please practice pack-it-in, pack-it-out when utilizing this park resource. Beyond Smith Gap visitors will notice the forest beginning to change as the trail continues to climb and enters a drier portion of the park. The cedars are replaced by lodge pole pine in this section of the forest. Once visitors reach the Day Mountain Road intersection, located approximately a quarter mile beyond Smith Gap, they've joined the old Cook auto route. A stone wall near this intersection is all that remains from a 1932 monument, set up at a location where overheated vehicles needed to stop while their drivers added water.  As the trail contours around the backside of Mount Kit Carson there are more views to the west and north. At approximately the 4 mile mark, the trail enters an area of private in-holding that was logged; soon thereafter the forest increases in density again. At around the 5 mile mark, visitors can see the west side of Mount Spokane for the first time. At 6 miles, the Civilian Conservation Corps Heritage Area is accessible via a short spur trail. A CCC camp during the Great Depression, this area was later used as the park headquarters. The rebuilt cabin in this location is a popular snowshoe and snowmobile warming hut during the winter. In the summer, visitors can choose the cabin or the outside picnic tables, depending on the weather. From here it's only a half mile to the Upper Mount Kit Carson Loop Road trailhead.  Note that the Upper Mount Kit Carson Loop Road trailhead is not accessible by vehicle during the winter months. It is possible to hike here utilizing other connector trails within the park.","driving_directions":"For the Lower Mount Kit Carson Loop Road trailhead, drive from the Park entrance on Highway 206, continuing on Mount Spokane Park Drive for approximately 1.8 miles to the hairpin turn parking lot.

Named for the rivers of rocky lava that surround the trail, the 10.8-mile Worm Flows route ascends nearly 5,700 feet to the summit of Mount St. Helens. Although challenging, this standard winter and spring route provides a non-technical climb for experienced hikers craving sweet summit views and a chance to practice basic mountaineering skills.Start at the Marble Mountain Sno Park.

Just like on that other Larch Mountain, there are no larches on this peak either—early loggers referred to noble firs as larches.At about 1 mile, ignore a side trail that heads right. Shortly afterward, bear right. The way should be signed—stay on the Tarbell Trail. At 1.2 miles, in an attractive grove of mature timber, cross Grouse Creek (elev. 2800 ft) on a big bridge. Then, after passing by shrubby vine maple patches (pretty in fall), emerge at 1.7 miles on a bear-grass-rimmed ridge (elev. 2975 ft) above a big talus slope and find excellent views of Silver Star Mountain, the Dole Valley, and Mount Saint Helens in the distance. This is the highlight of this hike. Feel free to call it quits here.But if you’re summit bound, continue another 0.7 mile along pleasant trail lined with ferns and bear grass to a signed junction (elev. 3300 ft). Head left on a rocky path for 0.4 mile, passing a spur on the right to a sprawling bear grass meadow. Arrive at the 3496-foot summit, where towers and a road greet you.

The area is so important, in fact, that it has been established as important habitat for the deer, and there are three monitoring points in the preserve to observe the shrub steppe as it is being reclaimed to native habitat. The trails were well-maintained and popular with locals as an after work location thanks to the views of the Wenatchee valley from the summit. The area is a gift from the Jacobson family of Wenatchee, who donated 35 acres to the Chelan-Douglas Land Trust, the owners of Jacobson Preserve.

Historically, the meadows were home to a Native American guide who lived there before Rainier became a national park. Renowned for being able to \"live in two worlds\" So-To-Lick was dubbed Indian Henry by a mail carrier unable (or unwilling) to learn his real name. So-To-Lick guided the likes of John Muir, George Bayley, James Longmire and Philemon van Trump up sections of the massive mountain, but never summited it himself. Like many Native people, he considered the mountain sacred, never venturing onto the glaciers as it may bring bad luck.The tranquil meadows So-To-Lick called home are accessible a variety of ways, the trailhead near Longmire, along Tahoma Creek just off the now-closed West Side Road, and the Kautz Creek trailhead, just off the road into the park, before arriving at Longmire. However you decide to access them, plan your hike for a clear day, when you'll be rewarded for your efforts with glorious views of Mount Rainier, Closer in, you'll also enjoy views of Copper Mountain, Pyramid Peak, and Iron Mountain.Leave Longmire and head for the Trail of Shadows, back out on the main road and several hundred feet west of the main parking area. Look for signs indicating Rampart Ridge Trail. This is your route. On the Rampart Ridge trail, you'll switchback through old-growth forest, to a ridgeline, which you'll pass over, now hiking down towards the junction with the Wonderland Trail. On your way, enjoy massive vistas of The Mountain, as well as the Nisqually drainage far below. Three miles from Longmire, turn left onto the Wonderland trail. Mile for mile, the Wonderland Trail is widely considered more strenuous than its much-longer counterpart, the Pacific Crest Trail, because of the seemingly endless elevation gain and loss. This next section will give you a good taste of that.After all that elevation gain out of Longmire, you'll descend steeply to a crossing of Kautz Creek before heading right back uphill on the Wonderland. 5 miles in, find Devils Dream Camp, a low spot between two steeply sloping walls. Despite being an established camp on the Wonderland, there is often no water here, though the deep forest does provide some shade.Finally, after Devils Dream the grade moderates, and the trail continues past Squaw Lake and wildflower-stuffed meadows of the old hunting grounds.

Now the old railroad (which never got near Walla Walla) has become a pleasant woodland trail that follows the edge of the forested gorge of May Creek.The trail drops down some steps into the deep forested valley of May Creek. After a short traverse, the trail reaches the old railroad grade, which crossed the valley on a long-gone trestle bridge.The May Creek Trail continues heading east along the edge of the valley, the soft rush of mighty May Creek coming up from below. May Creek is the third largest tributary of Lake Washington, and can have an impressive flow of water in winter. After 0.8 miles from its start, the trail arrives at Sylvan Creek's small ravine, which it crosses on a fill. Just beyond the creek is a house with a horse paddock; the trail passes to the right of the house, then reenters forest.Still following the old railroad grade, the trail reaches a grassy strip, the Waterline Trail, about a half mile from Sylvan Creek. Just before the Waterline Trail, look for a trail branching off right toward May Creek. This is the continuation of the May Creek Trail. The path descends on nice switchbacks down to the lushly vegetated floor of May Creek's valley. Part way down is the shell of an rusty old van (1950s vintage perhaps) that has been turned into a display of sorts, complete with protective fence.The trail comes quite close to the rushing waters of May Creek, a pleasant spot to rest for a bit, then after crossing a big, brand-new bridge over Lake Boren Creek, it gradually climbs to meet Coal Creek Parkway near the May Creek Road intersection.Walking the whole length of the May Creek Trail and back covers about 3.5 miles. If you want more exercise, you can cross Coal Creek Parkway and head into \"The Highlands\" development, where there is a network of greenbelt trails (shown on the Cougar Mtn Green Trails map). Above The Highlands, you can continue hiking on the Terrace Trail and head into Cougar Mountain Park itself.","driving_directions":"","distance":"3.5 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.5226490083","longitude":"-122.165549397","elevation_gain":"","highest_point":""},

Fortunately, the best of the trail is the northern end, where you’ll find grand views, rich huckleberry brambles, and endless opportunities to enjoy wildlife—especially the feathered variety. The Easton area is home to one of the largest populations of turkey vultures in the state, and the massive birds of prey (or birds of opportunity, if you prefer) soar en masse over the thermal-producing faces of Easton and Kachess ridges. Of course, those big birds of opportunity are here for a reason—the region has healthy populations of mammals, big and small, from marmots to mountain goats, beavers to bull elk.

It travels through big ponderosa and sweet-scented sage to glistening granite ledges, granting extensive views of nearby rock and distant hazy hills. Hot in the height of summer, this hike is a delight in early season when patches of snow prohibit wheels, or in early autumn when cool air blows down from the passes and the majestic larches turn the Eagles golden.Eagle Lakes Trail No. 431 begins in forest thinned by past logging, but a few large ponderosa pines still grace the way.

Once you reach the top of the road, however, you’ll be rewarded with an entirely unobstructed view of the North Cascades. This is the where the hike begins.From the trailhead, simply follow the well-maintained Pacific Crest Trail north 3.5 miles until you reach Windy Pass. You will first meander under the slopes of Slate Peak and then drop into Benson Basin where you will find more possibilities for exploring and flowers. Then head up to a spur ridge and contour to Buffalo Pass-- a nice spot for a snack and more photos--before descending to Windy Pass.As you hike along the relatively flat trail, you’ll encounter breathtaking views at every turn: Gardner Mountain, the Needles, Silver Star, Golden Horn and nearby Ballard and Azurite are to the south. Look west to Jack and Crater and look east to the Pasayten Wilderness. Time your trip right and you’ll find wildflowers decorating the sides of the trails. If your knees start to flare up, search for a ski yurt tucked into the mountainside about 2.5 miles in and make that your turn around point.Want to keep exploring? Windy Pass provides an ideal turn-around for a day hike, allowing you to return on the same trail and to view your surroundings from the opposite direction and slightly more elevation gain.

Access to the Wolf Creek trail is off of the Whiskey Bend Road in the Elwha Valley, or just off the Hurricane Hill Nature Trail, near the Hurricane Ridge Visitors Center. Coming from the Hurricane Hill junction, the way switchbacks down a gentle grade, allowing hikers plenty of opportunities to take in Alaska cedars which give way to madrones as you descend.

This up-and-down trail covers 21 miles with a cumulative elevation gain of almost 4,300 feet round-trip. Your reward for the effort is magnificent Gardner Meadows, a prairie-like valley set between towering peaks and jagged ridges. What makes Gardner Meadows so magical is its park-like setting and the amazing diversity of life within it. The trail rolls into the meadows over gentle grassy hills dotted with old growth fir. Mountains and dramatic ridges ring the valley on three sides. To the north, the rocky slopes of Mount Gardner seem to lean over you. To the southwest, Abernathy Peak rises high into the sky. Immediately to the south, the teeth of a folded ridge gnaw at the horizon. Throughout the meadows, Columbian ground squirrels scatter at your approaching footsteps, whistling warnings as they dive into their innumerable burrows. Deer wander down into the meadows at dusk and back up the hillsides at dawn. Signs of cat (perhaps lynx, perhaps something larger) abound. Across the rushing waters of Wolf Creek come the yips of coyotes (or perhaps wolves – from a distance, it’s hard to tell the difference). Bluebirds, owls and juncos may shadow you along the trail. In late spring, nearly every wildflower imaginable explodes from everywhere – arrowleaf balsamroot, shooting stars, lupine, avalanche lilies, alpine strawberries, and wild rose, among others too numerous to name. The trail starts by losing 250 feet in elevation (which of course means you re-gain that same elevation on your weary way out). Shortly thereafter, it enters the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness. At 2.6 miles, you cross the North Fork of Wolf Creek by way of a sturdy log bridge. At 3.7 miles, the trail traverses a slope of basalt that has crumbled to black sand. After that, it is a long march, devoid of major distinguishing features. There are a few camping spots along the way. Just after the crossing of the North Fork of Wolf Creek, a large meadow offers several places to pitch a tent, but this only takes you three miles towards your destination. A single camp site is available at 5.4 miles. There are several places to camp at the junction with the Abernathy Lake trail at 7.6 miles. Not long after the trail junction, you begin to leave the trees as you head into an area blackened by fire some time ago (judging by the size of the new growth, at least a decade past). As you close in on the meadows, you pass through a grove of aspen, seemingly out of place in this otherwise coniferous landscape. And then you arrive. From here, you have several options. Sit out on one of the large rocks or fallen trees and simply soak it all in. Follow the trail across Wolf Creek to its very end in a long abandoned mining claim. Find a spot in the trees to camp – there are several flat spots that make good sites. For the ambitious, an arduous climb to the summit of Gardner or North Gardner Mountain beckons. No matter what you do, remember – it’s more than ten miles back to your car!","driving_directions":"From Winthrop, turn right off of Highway 20 at White Avenue, just after crossing the bridge over the Methow River.

Take it a little slower and soak in the views by snowshoeing around a large lake rife with winter wildlife. With more than 13 kilometers of groomed nordic track, the trails here offer an all-day workout if that's what you seek. Shorter loops can be made of course,  and a seasonally established snowshoe trail provides a little more rugged route. Beginning from the Yurt, cross the groomed track and head toward the lake. Be sure to step over the nordic ski tracks, not in them, and look for cross-country skiers. Look for an orange diamond sign emblazoned with a black snowshoe -- these will be your markers as you make your way around the lake. The snowshoe track sticks close to the lakeside. Head east past your first marker, and begin your wending way along the side of the lake. The Lake Loop of the groomed trails parallels this track roughly, so you may see skiers to your right as you weave in and out of the forest on the edge of the delightfully named Leech Lake. At the northeast end of the lake, the groomed trail and snowshoe track meet up briefly to cross a bridge. Here you will see some interpretive signs telling you about the wildlife that can be found in the area. Continue across the bridge and look for the snowshoe track at the junction of two groomed trails. Here you have a decision. If you want to stick to the lake, it's about three-quarters of a mile along the track, and you'll simply continue across the bridge and look for the snowshoe route on your left past the bridge. If you want more of a workout, head up the hill at the intersection previously mentioned. You're heading on a steeper grade and a usually less-packed trail to Dog Lake and a small waterfall a little more than a half mile away. The trail becomes more forested as you had uphill. You'll cross three groomed trails along the way -- first the Corral Loop, where a summertime horse camp lies buried under snow. The second trail crossing is with the Deer Creek Loop -- an intermediate cross-country trail. Finally, arrive at your third trail junction, where four trails converge. To your left, The Hill ascends steeply, while straight ahead is the Biathlon Loop and to your right is the Dog Lake Loop. At the groomed trail, turn right and hike for a short distance on the edge (not in the center or on the ski tracks), looking for a trail disappearing into the woods on the opposite side of the road. Hop onto that trail, heading for those waterfalls! The grade is slightly shallower than what you've been on, and it wends and weaves through large trees and dormant creeks to a last junction. The falls are just down the spur trail to your left. After enjoying the falls, return to the trail and complete the loop by taking the trail you did not arrive by. This loops back around to the four-trail intersection, and you'll once again hike a short distance on the road to where the snowshoe track resumes. From here, you'll retrace your steps back to the lake and bridge, and look for another snowshoe track entrance on the near side of the bridge. Use this track to complete your circle of the lake and return to the yurt and parking lot.","driving_directions":"Drive Highway 12 east toward White Pass. Turn left into the Village Inn parking lot.

The trail begins in the phenomenal forests of the North Fork Sauk River Valley, passing giant Western Red Cedars, Douglas Firs, And Western Hemlock. At mile 1.9 pass the Pilot Ridge Trail junction. You will return to this point near the end of your trip. At 4.5 miles, pass a good campsite with a toilet at Red Creek and then at 6 miles, reach Mackinaw Shelter and the last dependable water before White Pass.Switchback steeply upward for another 2.8 miles through open avalanche tracks and meadows to the junction with the Pacific Crest Trail, turning right (east) on the PCT and hiking another  mile to White Pass. Good camps can be found below the pass. Turn right where the sign directs you down to the lower pass area and camps. Please respect the \"Camp Elsewhere\" signs and do not camp on the ridge above the camp area near the PCT. The Forest Service has spent decades working at restoring the delicate vegetation here, that had been badly impacted from over use.If you have the time, use White Pass as a base camp and take a side trip or two. The trail from White Pass along the base of White Mountain and out to the Foam Creek Basin is absolutely beautiful! Expect incredible meadows and flower shows. When the trail seems to disappear, hike up to the top of a small knoll and gaze out to breathtaking views in all directions. Glacier Peak dominates the scene but Mount Baker, Sloan Peak, Pugh, White Chuck and dozens of other peaks are visible. Look down from there into the upper White Chuck basin, a land of snow, rock and ice.Another highly recommended side trip from White Pass is to hike  west along the PCT to Red Pass and up to the summit of Portal Peak, just northwest of the pass. It's a fairly easy scramble on an established track along the ridge to the summit, although you may need to use your hands for balance in a place or two. More incredible views from there! Back down at Red Pass, you can continue hiking north and east on the PCT and down into the Glacier Peak Meadows area. Another interesting diversion is to hike to the top of the White Chuck Cinder Cone, visible just to the north of the PCT.To continue the loop from White Pass, head south on the PCT over miles and miles of mind-boggling ridges, meadows and flower fields, passing Reflection Pond, Kid Pond, Indian Pass, Kodak Peak, which is worth hiking to the top. One mile after passing the Little Wenatchee Trail junction, find yourself at Dishpan Gap. There is a great campsite here, despite being right on the trail. Hang a right at Dishpan Gap and hike west 0.8 miles. Bear right on the Blue Lakes High Route. This route is rough and passes over several sections of scree. You should feel confident in both your route-finding abilities and surefooted if you want to attempt this route. Alternatively, you can go around the High Route, and continue hiking another two miles west on the Bald Eagle Trail towards June Mountain, then turn right onto Trail 652 to Blue Lakes and proceed to Little Blue Lake. This adds about 4 miles to your loop.The Blue Lakes High Route ascends a steep, cairn-dotted trail to a high pass with a beautiful view across to Johnson Mountain and down to a sometimes frozen Blue Lake in a rocky basin below. The trail down from this notch to the lake can contain a very steep snow slope in early season. If you think you'll be uncomfortable on it, stick to the Pilot Ridge Trail to access Blue Lakes. Blue Lake is spectacular, and a wonderful place to camp. There is a good toilet near the campsites. Blue Lake also offers the last reliable source of water before the North Sauk.To continue onto the Pilot Ridge Trail, take the trail northeast from the lake outlet that descends to the Pilot Ridge Trail junction. Keep right at the junction, ascending through talus and scree for a bit an then on to the huge meadows that traverse the slopes of Johnson Mountain. The trail turns back to the east, following the west ridge of Johnson Mountain, reaching the Johnson Mountain Trail junction, Trail 652.2. With spectacular meadows, flowers and territorial views from the top, the short 0.5 mile side trip to the summit of Johnson Mountain is a must. The entire south Glacier Peak region lies before you. Check out the old lookout site and the four stone pillars that used to support the lookout. What a perch!Back at the junction, continue north and west on the Pilot Ridge Trail 652, crossing huge sloping meadows that seem to go on forever. The trail tread through these meadows has not received a lot of maintenance in past years, but is still fairly easy to follow. Eventually the trail finds its way down to the forest but then heads back up and down, and up,then finally  switchbacks relentlessly down for 2.5 miles to the North Fork Sauk River.The trail reaches the valley floor where you're able to cross the North Fork Sauk River on your choice of several stout logs. Walking through a small campsite on the river, you immediately reach the North Fork Sauk trail junction.

Follow a rudimentary trail across bluff tops and to shifting dunes. Survey a wild riverbank and a restricted area across the Columbia, where the atomic age was born.Since the Hanford Reach became a national monument in 2000 (see “From Manhattan Project to National Monument” sidebar), more and more hikers are discovering that what they thought would be a desolate part of the state is actually thriving with fauna and flora. Thanks to being withdrawn from the public for decades and remaining in a relatively natural state, the Hanford Reach represents one of the last large undeveloped and uncultivated parts of the Columbia Plateau. One of the driest parts of the state (annual rainfall averages 7 inches), the Hanford Reach is a harsh but fragile environment. Tread softly. And be sure you’re well prepared with ample water and sun protection.The unsigned and unofficial trail starts by a post near a grove of locust trees. At first grassy, then more defined, the path heads up an open slope that dazzles with flowers in spring. The impressive White Bluffs immediately come into view. So does the Columbia River. Watch for white pelicans below and swallows along the bluffs. At about 0.5 mile, stay on a path right, staying clear of the steep and prone-to-erosion bluff face. The path can be sketchy, vanishing at times in dunes. Just work your way up and down along the bluff tops, staying away from cliff edges.Enjoy excellent views of Locke Island below, Rattlesnake Mountain west, and Saddle Mountain north. At about 2 miles, reach impressive dunes that may make you feel like you’re in the Sahara. Walk across the dunes, continuing north. While always shifting, some of the higher dunes form pyramidal “summits,” topping out at elevations of more than 725 feet.From these vantages more than 300 feet above the river, you have commanding views of the shoreline below the bluffs. Scan it and the wetland pockets between the dunes for deer, coyotes, jackrabbits, and mice—there are three species of the latter: deer, western harvest, and the northern grasshopper mouse.At 3.5 miles, the dunes end. While you can continue hiking another mile farther north, paths are practically nonexistent and brush can be thick.

Marvel at the many large conifers and deciduous trees. View a small creek in a steep canyon. Listen for, and perhaps see, abundant bird life. And, in season, note a few wildflowers.You can download a park trail map from the specified link. Note that some older maps refer to the park as \"Weowna Beach Park,\" a complete misnomer since the park has no beach or lake front, and views out to Lake Sammamish are limited to occasional narrow openings through the foliage. The entire park offers many large conifers, apparently genuine old-growth as there is no sign of the large stumps seen in other areas that have been logged, such as at Tiger Mountain. Large deciduous trees also are present in Weowna Park.While this is not a wildflower hike, in spring you are likely to see a few blooms of salmonberry, thimbleberry, creeping raspberry, salal, avens, and a few others.The park trails are well constructed and have been barked for a soft footing. In steeper sections the route follows carefully built wooden staircases.As you leave the trailhead, the uphill begins immediately. You will gain about 230 feet in the first quarter mile to reach the highest point of the hike, where a short side trail heads west out of the park to SE 9th Street. The main trail leaves an old park road and continues on south, dropping gently for a while. In about a quarter mile, come to another park road heading east. The main trail leaves the road, continues across a couple of gullies, and comes to another side trail that leads out of the park to reach SE 16th Street. About 0.3 miles farther along on the main trail, come to a crossing of Phantom Creek on a rustic wooden foot bridge. The creek often is little more than a trickle, although the flow can be much greater after heavy rains.Ironically, Phantom Creek is completely artificial. It began in the 1890s when a would-be farmer near Phantom Lake, 0.3 miles to the west, sought to increase his farm acreage by lowering the lake level. The lake formerly drained to the west, but some powerful digging, plus blasting with dynamite, created a new channel draining east toward Lake Sammamish. The resulting deluge, while temporary, must have been impressive. It washed great amounts of sediment into Lake Sammamish and caused considerable damage to a lakeside farm. (All this in an era before environmental impact statements were required.) Many years later, the highly-eroded creek channel was restored by the city to resemble a natural stream, as you see it today. Just beyond the creek crossing, a short side trail leads out of the park to SE 19th Street. A few feet farther along, the main trail forks. For the best views of the creek and canyon, take the left fork. Near the upper end of the canyon two viewing platforms have been constructed to provide views of the creek, but the views often are limited by vegetation. Your best views of the creek may be found farther down the canyon, beyond the viewing platforms.At the next trail junction, stay left again. Follow Phantom Creek all the way down to street level where the creek flows into a wide settling pond designed to catch sediment that otherwise would end up in Lake Sammamish. The trail continues on a few feet more to W. Lake Sammamish Pkwy SE and a tiny parking area easily overlooked from the street.To continue your hike, head back upstream and, at the first signed trail junction, turn left onto the South Loop. In 0.3 miles, a short side trail heads out to 168th Ave SE. The South Loop trail continues on a quarter mile to reconnect with the main trail near the crossing of Phantom Creek, and from there you can return to your trailhead the way you came.","driving_directions":"Unless you are in Bellevue already, take I-90, Exit 13, to W. Lake Sammamish Pkwy SE and head north. At the roundabouts, continue on north. About 3 miles from the I-90 overpass over W. Lake Sammamish Pkwy SE, be alert for a wide shoulder along the left (west) side of the street with room for about six cars to park single file. A signboard visible from the road identifies the trailhead for Weowna Park. The parking area, such as it is, comes up quickly. If you miss it, or are unable to turn across oncoming traffic, continue on a quarter mile or so and turn around at a wide shoulder or a convenient cross street. Alternatively, if you are coming from farther North in Bellevue, take NE 8th St all the way east to the T-junction with Northup Way and turn right. Take Northup Way south 0.5 mile and merge with W. Lake Sammamish Pkwy SE. About a half-mile farther south, be alert for the trailhead parking area on the right.At the parking area, a small, easily-overlooked sign cautions that parking is for park visitors only and, at least to the right of the sign, it is limited to three hours. For most hikers this will be more than enough time to walk every trail in the park.The shoulder area described here offers the best of the meager parking options for Weowna Park. An even smaller shoulder area (three cars?) is located 0.8 miles further south, closer to I-90. It is even more difficult to spot from the street, and it has the same three-hour limit.Other possible trailheads are located along the western boundary of Weowna Park (Refer to the map.) Limited street parking may be available near the trailhead at the east end of SE 9th St. The other three west-side trailheads do not offer parking. If you are intent on using one of those western approaches you could explore parking options on the side streets, or could check for parking at nearby Lake Hills Park, four blocks west of Weowna Park, on 164th Ave SE between SE 12th St and SE 14th St.There are no facilities at any of the Weowna Park trailheads.","distance":"3.5 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.6085356199","longitude":"-122.111835479","elevation_gain":"600","highest_point":"320"},{"features":["Wildflowers/Meadows","Mountain views","Dogs allowed on leash","Ridges/passes","Good for kids","Rivers"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/north_cascades.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//48.1705,-121.4670/@48.1705,-121.4670,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/white-chuck-bench_outdoor-dam.jpg/@@images/84851646-06b3-422f-8e3f-63c8df27f2fc.jpeg","region":"North Cascades","current_rating":"2.70 out of 5","name":"White Chuck Bench","trail_description":"The White Chuck Bench trail is a beautiful, 2.5 mile walk in the woods along the White Chuck River.The entire hikeable length of the trail has been cleared by hardworking WTA crews after the 2003 floods rendered it nearly inaccessible.

Skirt the ledge above the White Chuck River, cross a sturdy wood bridge, and continue upstream, looking for peek-a-boo views of Mount Pugh and the surrounding summits.Don't miss the trees for the forest -- take time to look at individual cedars, hemlock and Douglas fir, which are fighting to see who among them wins the battle of succession. There are a few silver firs here, too. The trees in the area are second-growth, sprung up from former logging operations shut down about 80 years ago. It's amazing how large they can get in less than a century. The forest floor offers a wealth of life as well.

This nice little hike will take you around the lake on a hiker only trail.  Take this hike in spring for the fresh new leaves and the dainty spring flowers, or hike on a rainy day in winter and watch the mist float above the lake among the trees. The lake is very popular on hot summer days. Two trails start right at the trailhead. The left hand trail, #237 follows an old road directly to the lake. However, you'll take #201 on the right, the slightly longer route, but more of a true trail. Wind your way through the second growth of Doug-fir and cedar that make up this forest. The first swampy area of the many to be found on this hike will be along this section. Look for the bright yellow bracts and huge tropical looking leaves of our native skunk cabbage. The flowers are actually on the spike in the middle. Look closely and you may see a pollinating insect. This plant is found in freshwater swamps and along streams shaded by trees. In just under a mile, there will be an intersection with #21, go left on #21 and shortly there will be a three way intersection, a vault toilet and garbage can. Take #20 towards the lake, reach the northern end of the lake and intersect with #204. On the right there will be a sign for the Anacortes Forest Lands and the Kenny Oakes trail. Take #204 heading around the lake counterclockwise. Ignore all side trails heading uphill and stay along the lake shore trail. There are lots of inviting little vistas and great places for a picnic lunch along this section of shoreline. Admire the red bark of the Pacific madrone trees hanging over the water. Watch for ducks and other wildlife, if you are lucky, you may see an eagle or even a coyote. The trail leaves the shoreline and climbs above it, then through a small section of woods. There is lots of our native red huckleberry growing on old nurse logs. A member of the blueberry family, it has bright orange berries in the summer which are edible, but very sour. You may see the distinctive basal leaves of rattlesnake orchid, a green rosette with prominent white veining. The flowers will be a stalk of small white orchid like flowers. Take a left on a little side trail that ends up on a large rock outcropping with a view of the lake and the island at the southern end. In spring, look for paintbrush, Oregon fawn lily and fritillaria, a dainty brown checkered flower.Head back into the woods and intersect with #21 and #202, head left on #21, then shortly reach another intersection. Here is a nice large wooden map with a ‘You Are Here' marker, showing you at the intersection of #21 and #22. Be advised, though, that this map is from 2007 and many of the trails are not on it. Take #22 left through the forest and past another swamp. Watch for trail #205, this will continue your journey around the lake, but it first goes through the woods around a rock bluff. Note the few large stumps left from the original forest. You will soon face another intersection; stay on #205. Pass Toot Swamp and speculate on how it may have gotten the name. Cross a cute little wood bridge, reach the lake again, and begin heading uphill. Reach the top and the way flattens out before dropping back down to another intersection. Stay on #205. Once past the intersection the forest opens up and there are some nice rocks above the lake to enjoy lunch with a view. Once done with lunch, continue north until you hit the northern tip of the lake again. Return on the old road for a complete loop back to the trailhead. Extending your hike: The Anacortes Community Forest Lands covers 2800 acres and has miles of trails. It is possible to put together a much longer hike, including a hike to Mount Erie or Heart Lake. Be advised that many of these trails are open to mountain bikes, horses and motorcycles.  The ACFL is managed by the city of Anacortes and supported by a non profit citizens organization. Consider picking up an envelope at the trailhead and making a small donation.","driving_directions":"From I-5 in Mount Vernon, take the exit 230 for Hwy 20, signed for Burlington/Anacortes.

And despite being begun in 1989, it’s still not complete!The trail itself is unremarkable, but after reading the history of the sculpture, you may agree that it’s worth the stop, and the short hike to see it up close.The sculpture was designed and created by Chewelah sculptor David Govedare. He envisioned a 36-foot tall woven basket made of steel, tipped up by Grandfather (a symbol of the Great Spirit), to allow the 18 horses within to run free.The sculpture was to be completed and then presented as a gift during Washington’s Centennial celebration in 1989. The state ceded the land to Grant County for that purpose, but fundraising from private donations fell short and there was never enough money to complete the project. The 15 life-size galloping horses that were installed are a beautiful sight, regardless of the original plan. The sculpture as a whole is best seen from a distance. If you choose to take the short hike to the hilltop to see the individual horses, you’ll be rewarded with a nice view of the Columbia River and surroundings.From the far end of the paved parking lot, set out up the obvious trail heading up to the left of the sculpture. There are other faint trails visible, but please stay left on the main trail to minimize further erosion. The way is moderately steep, with sand and loose rocks; a hiking staff or trekking poles are helpful. A mere two tenths of a mile later, you are on top of the plateau featuring fifteen wild horses frozen in mid-gallop.The individual horses are best viewed in profile. The rust that has formed does not detract, but graffiti sometimes does.  There is plenty of room to wander among them for a whole new perspective, offering a variety of options for the photographer.

It has narrow ledges, sheer drop-offs, and rocky scrambles requiring the use of your hands. The route is not really a trail; it demands your focus, attention, and route-finding skills for two full miles. In wet or icy conditions, it may be impassable. Exposure is extreme; don’t attempt this in foul weather.If you are camped nearby (by permit only), the loop itself is 8.5 miles. If not, the stem of the “lollipop” begins at the Norway Pass trailhead. This guide describes a counter-clockwise loop. The advantages are a reliable water source, and an easier way to find the reroute around a treacherous section at the north end of the Whittier Ridge Trail. The disadvantage is a longer return route if you are forced to turn around.Head northwest on the Boundary Trail 1.1 miles to a junction with the Independence Ridge Trail, then go right one mile to Norway Pass. Continue straight 0.8 mile to a junction with the Lakes Trail and the beginning of the loop, at 2.9 miles. Take the Lakes Trail to the right, up and over Bear Pass at 4950 feet, then drop quickly behind a ridge that harbors shade, keeping the lupine blooming into late August. At 0.5 mile, Grizzly Lake pops into view suddenly. Drop to the shore of the log-littered lake and cross the outlet, then climb gently through salmonberry and young alder, passing a small stream at 1.3 miles. At 2.2 miles, 4450 feet, a sign announces Obscurity Lake. At 2.3 miles, cross the outlet of Boot Lake on a footlog to Obscurity Camp. Continue the pleasant, although sometimes brushy, path from lake to lake.Between the pan and the handle of Panhandle Lake at 3.3 miles is the lake's inlet stream, coming from Shovel Lake above. This is your last water before the Ridge trail. Fill up, then climb 600 feet in one mile, passing a side trail that leads down to Shovel Lake. Traverse to Pleasant Pass at 4.7 miles, 5190 feet, and the junction with the Whittier Ridge Trail.Just a tenth of a mile along the Whittier Ridge Trail, begin looking for the crucial correct path. Where the trail appears to continue straight to the southwest, look for a switchback to your left that ascends a small talus slope heading east. If you reach an impassable slide area, retrace your steps. The correct route is steep, circling out to the east before climbing to the top of the ridge due south of you.Once on top, there is no definite trail. You must route-find your way for nearly two miles, roughly following the ridge. Even a seemingly obvious path is not necessarily the correct route. (This is especially true 0.2 mile east of the Mount Whittier summit.)Scramble little ups and downs constantly to negotiate your way. Sometimes you must skirt drop-offs of several hundred feet. The views are outstanding in clear weather. But you will need to be more attentive to your footing than to the views. In some places, the route is so narrow that you want to be carrying nothing wider than a day pack. And there is no water along the ridgeline. Expect this section to take you 2 to 3 hours, depending on your skills.The Whittier Ridge Trail meets up with the Boundary Trail at 6.7 miles from your trailhead. Go east, passing Bear Camp at 7.3 miles, where you might refill on water, and close the loop back at the camp, making it an 8.5 mile loop (11.4 if you started from the trailhead at the road).

Though it's hidden behind a more than 12-mile road walk or bike, the West Fork Dosewallips River trail offers tunnels of rhododendrons, a jubilant river, and solitude. Less than ten miles west off Highway 101, begin hiking on the Dosewallips River Trail. This beginning is what's left of the road that previously went 5.5 miles further to the Dosewallips Campgrounds.The beginning of the trail goes up and over an improvised bypass to the road washout, passing some wonderful old growth trees along the way. Past the washout, drop back down to the abandoned forest service road and hike in the surreal world of Mother Nature overtaking where human's have been absent for more than ten years. One mile in, a left hand turn takes you to a bridge to nowhere, where you can watch the water flow by. A further 0.2 miles up the road, a left turn takes you to the abandoned Elkhorn Campground, replete with abandoned privy toilets and picnic benches. Despite its apparent remoteness, this is still a popular campground, so be sure to pack it out.Pressing further uproad, wander through second and old-growth forest as the river's noise keeps you company. 3.5 miles from the trailhead, encounter the park boundary. Pets are not allowed into Olympic National Park, so if you're traveling with a canine companion, this is where you'll need to turn around.Past the boundary, cross two bridges, the second of which is for Constance Creek -- the creek followed by the Constance Trail to Constance Lake and the summit of Mount Constance. At 4.5 miles, encounter a shoulder of Constance that comes almost straight down to the river except for a notch carved out. This notch allows you to walk to an overlook of the cascading Dosewallips Waterfall. Heading further, you hike up a short, steep hill to the head of the waterfall. Traffic signs abound, but can be ignored. Another half mile and you'll arrive at the abandoned 40 site campground. Stop at the campground for fine riverside dining, or continue on. Continuing takes you past the boarded up facilities of the park service. Less than a mile later, encounter the West Dosewallips Span, high above the crashing waters below. Just on the other side is a great site to sit for a good feed.","driving_directions":"From Quilcene, follow Highway 101 south for 11 miles to Brinnon.

Then enjoy a superb viewpoint a short distance west of the summit.To begin, step over the white gate near the High Point trailhead and proceed east a quarter mile on the paved road, dropping slightly. Cross over High Point Creek and, where the pavement ends, find the signed beginning of the High Point Trail. The trail loops around tiny High Point Pond and heads south, gaining about 200 feet in 0.3 miles before reaching a power line.A sign here indicates \"Lingering Trail,\" with a single arrow pointing south along your route. You're still on the High Point Trail. The sign is there because this is the former location of a junction with the lower end of the Lingering Trail. That trail has been rerouted, and you now will pass the junction 100 yards south of the power line. (The Lingering Trail is an option for your return hike.)Continue south on the High Point Trail, passing a junction with Dwight's Way. About 0.8 miles from the powerline--and up 500 feet--merge with the main Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT) at a signed junction. Turn left on the TMT (Right would take you to the big parking lot on Tradition Plateau.) In 0.1 mile pass a junction with the upper end of the Lingering Trail. Be sure to stay on the TMT, as it takes a sharp right turn here.Climb about 400 feet and, in a half mile, reach Ruth's Cove. In spring, be alert for coltsfoot, trilliums, yellow violets and other wildflowers here. Ruth's Cove is a pleasant spot where a relatively new small bridge crosses a tributary of High Point Creek. Skunk cabbage also blooms along the creek here in spring.Continue on another 0.4 miles, climbing about 200 feet, to reach Fred's Corner, a signed trail junction in an area of tall maples. While you are there, look up in the trees. It's not unusual to see a few wild pigeons - very different birds from their urban, street-smart cousins. The trail forks here, with the West Tiger RR Grade heading left and the TMT going right. Leave the TMT and continue left on the W. Tiger RR Grade. Climb steeply and, in 0.4 miles, reach a signed junction with the Preston Trail (formerly the \"West Tiger No. 1 Trail,\" a name your map may still use.) Turn right on the Preston Trail and climb steadily, gaining about 600 feet in a half-mile, to reach a junction with the Bootleg Trail.The ongoing Preston Trail continues on west below the ridge top. In 2014, the slope above the trail was clear-cut. Trees at the edge of the trail now are subject to the full force of storm winds, and there have been some blowdowns.As of winter 2015, part of the Preston Trail was completely blocked by a massive blowdown. Check recent trip reports for the current status.In less than a quarter-mile, come to a signed junction with the Poo Top Trail. Here, to reach the summit of W. Tiger No. 1 (or as close as an electronics tower will allow) you need to take a short side trip. Hike up the Poo Top Trail, gaining about 75 feet on four short switchbacks to reach a high point next to a large granite boulder. At 2948 feet, this is the second highest summit in the Tigers (only East Tiger, at 3004 feet, is higher.) It may seem somewhat anti-climactic, both because of the adjoining tower, and because there is no view. But don't despair! You soon will have your view. The Poo Top Trail continues on south to meet up with the TMT and the Hidden Forest Trail. But that's for a different hike! For today, turn around and take the Poo Top Trail back down to the Preston Trail (from this side the sign says it's the Bypass Trail, because it bypasses the electronics.) Turn left and continue west on the Preston/Bypass Trail a quarter mile. Pass through some very dark forest and emerge abruptly into the bright sun (clouds permitting) at the Hiker's Hut Viewpoint.The hut itself is a small, round metal structure that might serve as a very basic storm shelter in winter. A graveled service road arrives here from the west to reach the electronics gear, and a bench is available across the road. Sit and take in the view. On a clear day, Mount Rainier will be directly in front of you and of a large swath of the Olympics will be visible to your right.While you are at the viewpoint, you may be visited by a few grey jays hoping to beg a sample of your lunch, but be sure not to feed them. Humming birds also often are seen here and, in summer, large dragonflies. In spring, check the surroundings for wildflowers such as lupine and tiger lily--a few years ago tiger lilies bloomed right under the bench!When you have had your fill of the view, and finished your lunch, it's time to think of returning. Either head back the way you came, possibly taking the optional Lingering Trail, or see below for another possibility.Extending your hikeWith a little additional effort you can include the W. Tiger No. 2 summit in your hike, then see some different trails on your way back down to Fred's Corner to rejoin your ascent route. This option adds a half-mile to your distance, and an additional 250 feet to your total elevation gain.If this sounds appealing, hike down the gritty service road, dropping about 400 feet. Come to a metal gate adorned with crude lettering \"No Trespassing.\" That's just meant to discourage unauthorized vehicles. Hikers are welcome to proceed around the right end of the gate on a short trail signed \"W. Tiger No. 2 Trail.\" Once you are past the gate, the road again serves as your ongoing trail.Continue on the road, gaining about 250 feet, to reach the West Tiger No. 2 summit. There's not much of a view. A signed trail continues on west 0.4 miles to the ever-popular W. Tiger No. 3 summit. But, unless you are seeking lots of company, or are intent on traversing all three West Tiger summits today, don't go there.Like many Tiger summits, W. Tiger No. 2 has its share of electronics gear. Hike up to the surrounding metal fence and head around the right (east) side, where you will find a sign for the ongoing W. Tiger No. 2 Trail. Descend this short trail, dropping 270 feet, to reach the TMT at Tom's Crossing. It's the highest point on the TMT at about 2,500 feet. It's not actually a crossing, but a T-junction (as in \"crossing the T.\")Turn right on the TMT and continue descending on a few switchbacks. When you reach the junction of the TMT and K-3 Trails you will be faced with a three-way trail split. The left fork is the \"unmaintained\" K-3 Trail, the center fork is the former route of the TMT (now just a way to connect with the W. Tiger RR Grade) and, since fall 2014, the right fork is the ongoing TMT (Your map may not show this change.)Continue on the new TMT, descending gently and crossing High Point Creek on a new, very secure bridge. Descend some more and reconnect with the former route of the TMT east of the creek. The ongoing TMT from here initially is fairly level, then it drops steeply to reach Fred's Corner.From Fred's Corner, either return to your trailhead at High Point the way you came or, optionally, when you come to the junction for the Lingering Trail, take it instead. The Lingering Trail passes through some nice forest and crosses Dwight's Way before rejoining the High Point Trail just above the power line.","driving_directions":"From I-90, a few miles east of Issaquah, take Exit 20 (High Point) and turn south on 270th Ave SE. Just a few yards south of I-90, note a large, white gate on your left across SE 79th Street, signed \"Road Closed.\" Your hike will begin behind that gate so you need to look for roadside parking immediately (i.e., do NOT continue on to the usual parking lot 0.8 miles west.) Here, as at many trailheads, occasional car break-ins have been reported. To minimize risk, try to park with most of your car visible from the road, and leave no valuables in your car. A Discover Pass is required here. There are no facilities.As a possible alternative for hikers who don't have the use of a car, King County Metro bus Route 208 runs between Issaquah and North Bend, and on weekdays it has a stop at 270th Ave SE, just a short walk from the trailhead. There are only a few buses each day, so be sure to check schedules carefully at metro.kingcounty.gov, including any connecting routes, if you use this option.","distance":"7.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.530434","longitude":"-121.9794266","elevation_gain":"2450","highest_point":"2948"},{"features":["Mountain views","Wildlife","Good for kids"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/issaquah_alps.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//47.5143,-122.0770/@47.5143,-122.0770,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/west-access.jpg/@@images/381101f0-55b6-4f28-ac39-0fef5e83aa2d.jpeg","region":"Issaquah Alps","current_rating":"2.40 out of 5","name":"West Access Trail","trail_description":"The western approach to Squak Mountain provides great access to  a number of loop trails around the upper reaches of Squak Mountain, including direct access to the East Side Trail and May Valley Loop Trail from the Squak Mountain State Park Trailhead.Parking here is very limited, so consider parking at the Wilderness Peak Connector Trailhead 100 yards up the road.","driving_directions":"The trailhead is about a half-mile north of the Wilderness Creek Trail for Cougar Mountain on SR 900, and 100 yards north of the Wilderness Creek Connector Trail on SR 900.","distance":"1.1 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.5143348576","longitude":"-122.077039182","elevation_gain":"800","highest_point":"1340"},{"features":["Wildlife","Summits","Lakes","Rivers","Wildflowers/Meadows","Mountain views","Dogs allowed on leash","Established campsites","Waterfalls","Old growth","Good for kids"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/eastern_washington.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//48.9030,-119.4236/@48.9030,-119.4236,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/whistler-canyon-t-murray.jpg/@@images/b105dc65-c0cb-4d25-9fef-8515a6995c2b.jpeg","region":"Eastern Washington","current_rating":"0.00 out of 5","name":"Whistler Canyon Trail","trail_description":"This trail offers vistas of the Okanogan River and Pasayten Wilderness as well as wildlife viewing potential for hikers of all experience levels.

It also has terrific wildlife viewing possibilities. Hikers commonly report seeing mountain goats on rock faces above the trail. Mule deer, bear, marmot, and wild turkey have often been sighted here as well.The trail has something to offer everyone: it is excellent for hikers and equestrian riders and even has some challenging areas for rock climbers.Like the rest of the region, it is often pretty dry, with lots of sun exposure, so come prepared. You can do a day hike out and back (actually up, then back down) from the trailhead on Highway 97, roundtrip up to 24 miles.Two good side trip options are available from the 97 trailhead. The first is the Frog Pond Trail, which leaves Whistler Canyon Trail at 0.32 miles and is 1.6 miles total out to the pond and back to the trail. All in all, a great little hike if you only have a few hours to spare. The second is a half-day side loop called the Black Diamond Trail.

The trail is steep and the tread is narrow, but it offers progressively better views above 4000 feet, north toward Thorp Mountain and the Snoqualmie Peaks, especially from West Sasse Peak. The trail ends at the junction with Sasse Mountain trail, where myriad opportunities to continue into the Teanaway are available. Only hikers and horses are allowed on this trail. Due to it's being abandoned, it is not much used, and while it stays in fair shape during the summer, trail maintenance crews do not make it here often, so expect obstructions. Volunteer crews do visit occasionally to keep the way clear, but the tread becomes very faint at the top. The trail climbs from the trailhead at a grade of about 1000 feet per mile for 3.5 miles, so it is for seasoned hikers. The tread is slumping and narrow in places, having not been maintained in many years.Note that should you elect to hike this trail, there are mapping errors and in many cases it doesn't appear at all. USGS Cle Elum Lake does not show the trail at all. Your best bet is Green Trails 208 for Kachess Lake, but note that the easy crossing of Howson Creek is at around 2700 feet, not 2900 feet as indicated. Also, once you get to the saddle at 5350 feet, the trail continues directly east up the ridge toward Sasse Mountain to around 5500 before it turns sharply south a few hundred yards to the Sasse Ridge Trail.  The Green Trails map erroneously places the trail a few hundred vertical feet lower on this section where no trail exists.The trail begins in quiet forest, following an old forest road to Howson Creek. Crossing the creek, it switchbacks up through the edge of an old clearcut above the creek. At 3350 feet there is a second creek crossing. Despite this, bring plenty of water with you, since there is no water past this point, and this creek may run dry late in the season.Above 4000 feet the trail is back in light forest, with game trails entering from the north. As it nears 5000 feet, it crosses a talus slope with nice views toward the French Cabin Peaks.From the mostly open saddle, an unmarked trail heads north, while the main trail, indistinct at first, heads directly east up the ridge until it turns right at 5500 feet through forest to the meadows on Sasse Ridge. As it enters the meadow, the trail disappears. Head left and down to intersect the Sasse Ridge trail at 5550 feet. Find a metal \"Howson Creek\" trail sign deeply embedded in a tree, facing south.The wooded summit of Sasse Mountain is only a few hundred yards north up the wide Sasse Ridge Trail. Beginning here, mountain bikes are allowed. For a longer trip continue north to Jolly Mountain. If you're more interested in another peak-bag, head back the way you came to the saddle.

It’s also attainable as a day hike, but you’ll want to get an early start. Note that the round trip mileage given above is for a day hike from the Lake Stuart trailhead. From Lake Stuart, follow the lakeshore trail back towards Mount Stuart pass several campsites before delving into denser forest. The rough path is relatively easy to follow, though the many downed trees that cross the trail can be frustrating, and when wet, slippery and dangerous. Take your time and watch your step here when it’s raining or if the wood is wet. The trail winds in and out of the forest for two miles, dipping into a marshy meadow at the head of the valley before ultimately heading back into the forest. After about two miles of hiking, you'll make a righthand turn and start hiking uphill. It’s a no-nonsense route that climbs essentially straight up.Watch your footing the entire way up, as the trail is rooty, rocky, and sometimes so straight up that it’s more like climbing a ladder than hiking uphill. Grus, or crumbled granite, can make for slippery conditions on trail, particularly where you’re hiking on larger granite slabs. The final push to the lake is nearly vertical; a thigh burner going up and one that calls for extra caution descending. At the lake, photo opportunities abound. Granite, larches, and the water full of glacial till make for stunning photographs. There are also plenty of observation points available--look down on Horseshoe Lake and Lake Stuart, from a craggy rock outcropping, or gaze across the valley to Mount Stuart and the other rocky massifs that form the head of the valley. WTA Pro Tip: Snow lingers here for much of the year, so expect to run into some, whether on your way to the lake, or as you wander in the meadows around it.

An easy trail with few ups and downs makes the hike suitable for a first-time overnight trip; a sparkling lake—one of the few hike-in lakes in northeast Washington—will coax weary backpackers onward.Beginning at Trout Lake, cross the outlet creek on a sturdy footbridge and begin switchbacking up through a forest of western redcedar. Moss-draped rocks and hollylike creeping Oregon-grape are reminiscent of Western Washington woods—the wetter east side of the Kettle Range contains many such pockets of surprisingly lush forest. The route quickly opens up to grassy slopes, out of which jut old-growth ponderosas and magnificent rock formations. In late spring, scan the slopes for shooting star, balsamroot and scarlet paintbrush. Reed-ringed Trout Lake lies below.In about 1.5 miles, pass through a dark birch forest. A slight switchbacking rise provides the last real climb of the hike in. In more than 2.5 miles, the trail forks. The way right continues on Hoodoo Trail, which crests the canyon with a falcon’s-eye view into Emerald Lake and its tiny neighbor Lily Lake—a worthy side excursion. For the lake itself, turn left, switchbacking 600 feet down to aptly named Emerald Lake. Linger for lunch or set up a tent in one of a handful of dispersed campsites. Watch for moose, which frequent the shallow lake. In dry years, the lake nearly disappears by late summer.

The second, more difficult to reach, is North Lake, an additional 2.2 miles up the trail.The trail starts off with a series of short switchbacks in an old clearcut before turning gentle and meandering off into old-growth forest.

As on most hikes which span such elevation changes, you'll enjoy seeing different wildflowers as you gain elevation. Balsamroot bobs at the trailhead, and hikers pass through Ponderosa pines, lupine, and then purple penstemon, even Tweedy's Lewisia as you leave the forest and traverse through rockier terrain. Just a quarter-mile into the trail, as you enjoy the balsamroot, cross Fourth of July creek, and get ready for another crossing in a little more than another quarter-mile. From here, the grade increases significantly and does not relent until you arrive at the lookout. There is one water source about 2.5 miles into the hike, but if you have the means, there will be snow to melt at the summit. Fortunately, the flowers provide a welcome distraction from the switchbacks as you climb.  Arrive at an old burn about 3.6 miles in, where the mountain laurel lies thick against the path and Jacob's Ladder blankets the floor.

You got it on the Huckleberry Mountain Trail. But there’s a price to pay in vertical gain, 5800 feet worth if you want to go all the way to the old lookout site. Settle instead for a 5483-foot knoll, saving yourself 1200 feet and 2 very difficult miles. The views are just as grand from this locale, encompassing the deep, dark emerald valleys and countless craggy, snow-capped peaks and ridges of the Glacier Peak Wilderness, one of the wildest corners in the Lower 48.Starting from valley bottom, the Huckleberry Mountain Trail is one of the last “complete” trails left in the North Cascades. A half century of aggressive logging severed many of our trails from their valley roots (or worse, obliterated them). Miraculously, Huckleberry Mountain’s trail and more importantly its forests were spared this fate. On this trail you can propel yourself back in time to when it took time to reach coveted summits and high ridges. But more than mere time is required for this trek: you’ll also need excellent endurance and a good cardiovascular system.Starting under a glorious canopy of ancient Douglas-fir, the trail begins its long and winding way up the mountain. While the grade is good and the tread intact, undergrowth is encroaching upon this trail that receives little maintenance. (Actually, in these days of budgetary neglect, most of our trails receive little maintenance—a national shame.)The trail alternates between short switchbacks and long traverses as it works its way up the broad mile-high peak. Well-shaded and near water for much of the way, this part of the strenuous hike at least won’t threaten you with overheating. Finally, at about 4.5 miles and 4500 feet above the Suiattle River valley, the grade eases as you attain the ridge crest. By late summer you’re looking at a dry run along the ridge, so be sure water bottles are adequately filled.Through thinning forest and expanding meadows, enjoy expansive views east over the Suiattle to Glacier Peak, south to Whitehorse and White Chuck, and west to the Finney Block. Continue along the ridge, straddling the Glacier Peak Wilderness boundary—old growth to the east protected, old growth to the west fate unknown.At about 6 miles, on fading tread, attain a 5483-foot knoll and a logical and sane post for calling it a day and savoring views.

This trail is primarily used by hikers heading to the summit of McGregor Mountain, the most prominent peak towering over the Stehekin Valley, but Howard Lake is a nice destination in and of itself, if you don’t have the time or the desire to tackle the 16 mile roundtrip hike up McGregor. Originally named Coon Lake, this little lake has become known as Howard Lake in many circles. The name is after Wilson Howard, who lived nearby and who was one of two black miners to stake mining claims in the North Cascades. The lake is accessed by a section of the Pacific Crest Trail, which continues north past the turnoff for Howard Lake. Originally, this section of trail functioned as an access road for miners in this area from nearby Bridge Creek camp. Howard had mining claims here in the 1890s. While some believe the former name came from raccoons that lived in the area, many believed it was a racial epithet. Since 2009, many have called for the name to be changed to honor Howard and the unique life he had, but as of this 2015 writing, the change is still awaiting final approval by the Washington State Board for Geographic Names. However, most individuals and groups have made the change to Howard Lake. From the High Bridge Guard Station (a remnant from the era of the Civilian Conservation Corps), look for a trail heading north. This is the Pacific Crest Trail. Follow it along the base of a small knoll, heading northeast along wide tread before it makes a turn and begins climbing moderately on more rugged terrain.The landscape goes from open Ponderosa forest to a greener, more lush area in just half a mile. As the trail switchbacks uphill, look for a junction with a trail signed as the Cascade Horse Trail. The horse trail heads right, but you will switchback yet again and continue on the left-hand trail, continuing to climb and following the Pacific Crest Trail to a turnoff signed for McGregor Mountain. Just a few hundred feet down this trail, find Howard Lake.A large rock makes a great spot for picnicking and relaxing. Take in 8000-foot McGregor Mountain towering over you, and listen to wildlife all around you. If you like, retrace your steps and explore further north on the Pacific Crest Trail.

But there's a bonus to that aspect. This trail often melts out by mid-May, providing early season high-country probing while surrounding trails remain buried in winter's white.

The trailhead off 9712 is the high point of the Howard Creek trail. From here, the trail descends along the headwaters of Howard Creek, crosses the creek, climbs to a bench. It then passes through several decades-old clearcuts, crosses Forest Road 3530 and continues west to its end at junction with Naneum Creek Trail 1381.Most people, however, take the Howard Creek trail just 1.4 miles, before arriving at a junction with Trail 1373.

The interpretive loop trail has a gentle grade and scenic views of Icicle Creek, Icicle Gorge, and the surrounding forest that are ideal for families, trail runners, beginner hikers, bird enthusiasts, and those looking to take a nice long walk on a well-defined path.   Start your hike from the parking lot, following the main trail to an information kiosk. Pick up a map of the trails and pause a moment to get your bearings. Read about the wildlife, conservation initiatives, and distinctive habitats in the surrounding area on signs pinned to the kiosk.Continuing on the trail, come to a sign marked Icicle Gorge View River Loop. Turn left to start the four mile loop in a clockwise direction or turn right to do the loop in a counterclockwise direction. There is varied ecology to savor throughout the trail and you will encounter scenic views of the Icicle Creek Valley in either direction, but this description will take you on a clockwise loop. Turning left, walk on the wide, well-traveled trail through the forest and come upon your first glimpse of Icicle Creek after about a quarter of a mile. A small bench on the left encourages a welcome rest, followed by the first of six interpretive signs you’ll encounter along the trail. Pause for a moment here to read about the aging lodgepole pine trees above you and the animal habitats they nurture.  Continuing along the trail, look to your right at Icicle Creek and enjoy the varying shades of green and aqua colors shimmering below the surface.  Arrive at the Icicle Creek Bridge and spot another interpretive sign about the animals and plants that make the unique habitat here their home. As you cross the bridge, take a moment to enjoy the views of Icicle Gorge and the rushing, turbulent waters of Icicle Creek below you. Reaching the other side, you are now on the south side of Icicle Creek. The trail briefly continues along the creek before winding through a more heavily forested area. Pause at an overlook perched above the Creek, almost a mile into your hike, and continue through the forest to a cedar swamp.  Read about the cedar swamp on an interpretive sign as well as plants such as devil’s club: a shrub with large, maple-like leaves and small spines that are prickly to the touch.  Keep your eyes peeled for scampering chipmunks and squirrels and listen for the tap-tap sound of pileated woodpeckers that call this area home.After crossing a couple small wooden bridges, spot the small blue berries of Oregon grape lining the trail. Continue over bridges for Trout Creek and Jack Creek, and pause at two interpretive signs near Jack Creek to read about how plants, insects and fish thrive underwater and how birds, beetles and fungi are helping a nearby tree decompose. Enjoy the peek-a-boo views of Icicle Creek beginning to re-emerge about two and a half miles into your hike, and cross a wide wooden bridge to reach a junction with Road 615.  Bear right to stay on the Icicle Gorge Trail. As you continue on, look down at the views of Icicle Creek below you, being mindful of the steep drop-offs on the righthand side of the trail.  Continue on through a lovely section of tall conifers with views of nearby peaks in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Pass campsites for Rock Island Campground on your right, and emerge onto Forest Road 7600. Keep to the right on the road and cross the Rock Island Bridge, returning to the north side of Icicle Creek. Continue to a sign marked Icicle Gorge Trail River Loop, turning right to rejoin the Icicle Gorge Trail. There are picnic benches available here as well as a water fountain and vault toilets.Enjoy plentiful views of Icicle Creek as you continue through this area. At a fork in the trail, head left to check out an interpretive sign on a plant called pine broomrape, or head right to walk a rockier trail closer to Icicle Creek. Either one will work: the trails rejoin in a short distance.  Cross a wooden bridge over Boggy Creek, and about 3.4 miles into your hike, notice a trail on your left that leads towards Forest Road 7600. This is an access point for the Icicle Gorge View Trail, a steeper, less traveled loop trail that climbs to higher-up views of the Icicle Creek Valley as well as Bootjack Mountain and Icicle Ridge.To complete the Icicle Gorge Trail loop, continue straight on the trail past this junction. Pass by a couple exposed areas with benches that overlook Icicle Creek: good choices for a picnic lunch or a snack break. The parking lot will soon come into view on your left; bear right on the trail to finish the loop.  Extending your Hike: Head up the steeper Icicle Gorge View Trail (called simply “View Trail” on the map provided at the kiosk) to add roughly an extra 1.25 miles to your hike. At one point the View Trail splits and parts of the trail are overgrown with brush; be sure to read the entry for the Icicle Gorge View Trail on this site for the best route to take.","driving_directions":"From the 76 gas station off US Highway 2, on the western edge of Leavenworth, head south on Icicle Road (Forest Road 7600).

If the water levels are low, parallel Hawk Creek on the trail and head down the fisherman’s trail over the bank at first opportunity to reach a sandy beach. You can continue for at least a mile if the conditions are right. When the beach disappears, you’ll come across a steep game trail leading up the slope.

This area lies midway along the 50-mile Grand Coulee—one of the longest and most spectacular chasms carved out by up to 100 gargantuan Ice Age floods.The floods originated from sudden outbursts of ice-dammed Glacial Lake Missoula as recently as 15,000 years ago. The height of the Ice Age floodwaters (800 ft deep), shooting over Dry Falls at perhaps 60-70 mph, was nearly the height of Seattle’s 76-story Columbia Center-Washington State’s tallest building.Following a red-marked loop trail, start by heading northeast in a counterclockwise direction along the base of Umatilla Rock via Monument Coulee.At a half-mile is a labyrinth of basalt pillars that have slumped and toppled away from the edge of Umatilla Rock during or soon after the last Ice Age floods. Continue northeast toward the upper end of Umatilla Rock. After 1.2 miles turn left around the north end of Umatilla Rock and follow red trail markers (or unpaved road) back to trailhead.

The trail crosses a picturesque footbridge and then follows the Lewis River with the river to the right and a mossy cliff to the left. The wide hard-surfaced trail is mostly flat, making this a perfect year round hike for people of all ages. This hike combines a peaceful stroll with a bit of adventure. After a short steep pitch down from the parking lot, the virtually flat trail allows you to cruise down the spacious path as fast or a slow as you like. For a side adventure, you can check out Big Tree Falls or climb the Bells Mountain Trail to a viewpoint.The drive to the trailhead follows part of the Clark County Scenic Drive and is worth the trip alone. The road follows a particularly beautiful stretch of the Lewis River as it flows over volcanic rock formations. The smooth rocks and small pools make this a favorite summertime place for locals to swim and sun. The road also passes the not-to-be-missed Lucia Falls. It is definitely worth stopping and taking the short walk to view one of the region’s most scenic water features. The hike starts at the Moulton Falls overflow parking lot near the junction of Lucia Falls Road with Sunset Falls Road. There are multiple paths in this area, so make sure to snap a photo of the map at the trailhead if you don’t have a map with you.  From the parking lot, turn left at the trailhead sign and go down the slope towards the river. Partway down the hill, you will come to a junction with a path leading off to the right. You will go left for this hike, but this is a good place to take a side trip to the right and go see Moulton falls. After you return to the trail, continue downhill to the arch bridge with its spectacular views of the Lewis River far below. On one side, the river flows through a narrow tree-lined canyon, and on the other side the river opens up to peacefully flow towards the falls. This is the best spot on the hike to take postcard-perfect pictures, so be sure to stop, enjoy the view, and take some photos. Just after the crossing the bridge, you will come to two junctions to the right leading to picnic areas. Keep left and stay on the wide path that follows an old road grade along the river through a mixed forest of big leaf maples, alders, cedars and Douglas firs. Although there is a road across the river, it is mostly hidden from view with the river masking the road sounds. A half mile from the trailhead, you will come to the Bells Mountain Trail. If you are feeling energetic, you may want to take a side excursion to a viewpoint 1.5 miles up the trail. This rigorous 1,000-foot climb will certainly earn you bragging rights if you decide to tackle it. Our hike, however, continues on the main trail along the river. In about a mile, the path leaves the river to follow the Chelatche Prairie Railroad to a small lake with a picnic area on the far end. This is a pleasant spot for a snack or picnic and is the turnaround point for this hike. If you would like a longer hike or need toilet facilities, you can go a half mile further to the Hantwick Road trailhead. After you turn around, retrace your steps back to your car.Before you leave, be sure to cross Lucia Falls Road and follow the trail to Big Tree Falls. These impressive Niagra-like falls are the best of the three in the park. When the steel bridge just below the falls is open, you can get striking views of the water as it churns through a narrow chasm beneath you. If the bridge is open, you can turn your trek into a 1.7 mile loop. Otherwise, turn around and return to your car.WTA Pro Tip: After the hike, consider stopping at one of the local wineries, soaking your feet in one of the pools along the river, or stopping at Rocky’s Pizza in Battle Ground for food in an eclectic old-west setting.","driving_directions":"From Vancouver drive north on I-5.

The trail now heads eastward along the ridge, and though you're still climbing, emerging views assuage your pain. Pugh, White Chuck, and Baker greet you first. Sloan and Bedal soon steal the show. As difficult as it may be to lift thine eyes away from them, hundreds of other summits are yelling out to be recognized: Stuart, Daniel, Del Campo, Morning Star, Sperry, and Vesper among them.After 1.5 miles of spectacular ridge running, come to an unmarked junction. The main trail continues right for miles and miles of amazing alpine wanderings. Take the trail left to a small gap (elev. 5600 ft) and a great view down to Round Lake twinkling in an open basin.

It was then converted to a two-lane paved private log haul road in the 1950s. After Champion Lumber Company closed its mill in Klickitat in 1994, the road was abandoned. The February 1996 flood washed out sections of the road, making it impassable to vehicles. In 2007, Columbia Land Trust purchased the road right-of-way and began a fish habitat restoration program to remove the asphalt and restore the river bank to bring back salmon and steelhead habitat. Now, the former road corridor is open to the public for hiking and mountain biking.The first two miles of the hike are on asphalt, then the pavement ends and turns to gravel for another one eighth of a mile or so before the restoration begins. The road bed has been pulled back, culverts removed and the slope of the river bank restored to allow the river to flow freely. There is a six to ten-foot wide shelf along cliffs -- this is the trail surface. In other stretches where there aren't cliffs and the road bed is back from the river, the route is on the former road now converted to dirt.After the first 1.5 miles of the hike, Highway 142 on the east bank turns away from the river. From that point on, traffic sound fades and the only noise is the rushing water and the calls and songs of birds. In autumn and winter, you may see bald eagles or spawning salmon, since the Klickitat River is a major gathering place for wintering bald eagles feeding on salmon carcasses. At 3.5 miles, the route reaches a backwater against a cliff about three feet deep. This is a good turnaround point; otherwise, the river must be waded in order to continue north. ","driving_directions":"Find the trailhead by driving north from Lyle on SR 142 through the town of Klickitat. Continue about 6 miles.

Most trails in the park highlight views of the main mountain, but here, it’s more about the surrounding peaks, which make the area seem more like somewhere in Alaska or Montana, rather than Washington. Add to that the fact that accessing this area now requires an approach hike in the double digits, and you’ve got a remote, high mountain valley where relatively few people come, despite the fact that it’s in Washington’s most popular national park.Beginning from the Carbon River, which requires a 5-mile road walk, arrive at Ipsut Campground. Stop here for a rest, then continue on, hopping onto the Wonderland and heading southeast. You'll pass Ipsut Falls, with the Carbon River on your left. After two miles on the Wonderland, arrive at an intersection where the trail to the left crosses the Carbon River. Take the left trail (the Wonderland continues on straight ahead). You'll press on for 0.4 miles, meandering on level ground through bright, green forest. The understory is lush, and berries abound, even here where it’s relatively shaded. The path is springy and soft from generations of pine needles.After 0.4 miles, turn left and gradually begin to climb. Then, the trail makes its first switchback, and you really start to understand just how much you’re going to have to push yourself up this hill.Luckily, the switchbacks are well-built, and if you get into a good plod coupled with plenty of sips of water, the 2 miles of switchbacks go by fairly quickly. But then, the switchbacks cease and it's a straight push uphill. As a recompense, you can catch glimpses through the open second-growth forest of rocky outcroppings, a hint of what’s to come at Yellowstone Cliffs.The trail narrows and steepens, pushing you higher and higher, until you’re 3.8 miles from the turnoff of the Wonderland. Just before you want to throw in the towel, you'll arrive at Yellowstone Cliffs camp. Nestled in a copse of woods at the base of Yellowstone Cliffs, this little campsite is near Spukwush Creek where you might want to replenish your water supply, or pitch camp if you’re overnighting. If you’re good on water and food, look to your left. You’re standing at the base of the cliffs, and you can see an area where a large chunk of rock sheared off many years ago.If you're heading to Windy Gap, continue heading uphill through switchbacks. It’s a steady uphill push, though now instead of being shaded by tall cedars and hemlock, you’re in a hillside meadow, where huckleberries and beargrass don’t do much to hide you from the sun. Put on some sunscreen before you get underway.After a dozen switchbacks, the trail becomes a tad more forgiving. The slope moderates, and you begin traversing to Windy Gap. It's 1.5 miles steadily uphill from camp to Windy Gap but once you arrive, you’ll realize how worth it all the climbing was. To your right are Crescent Mountain, complete with a crystalline tarn, and Sluiskin Mountain, craggier and more impressive. To your left, it’s Tyee Peak and the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest stretching north. Straight ahead, the trail winds away, down to campsites like James Creek, the White River, and eventually, Grand Park and Sunrise.As if this wasn’t enough, there’s one further option. The Natural Bridge is about a mile and a half further away, through the gap and down a side trail. It’s a wonderful diversion, if you have the energy, and it’s possible to see two large lakes, James and Ethel, from it. But Windy Gap is the real stunner here, and simply staying here and soaking the sights makes for a perfect day.","driving_directions":"From Puyallup, drive 13 miles east on State Route 410 to Buckley, then turn right onto SR 165.

For many, this is a gateway to other trails that lead on to more distant goals, such as the Adventure Trail (to the west end of Tradition Plateau,) the Poo Poo Point Trail (it gets to the point, of course) and the Section Line Trail (toward the higher Tiger summits.)Your hike can begin from either of two trailheads near Issaquah High School.If you are beginning at the northern trailhead at the end of SE Evans St (see Driving Directions) head south on the obvious trail (signed \"Trail\"). Avoid any side trails that head left into the forest. Just continue on south, pass the tennis courts and follow along a small power line. Soon, you will note a sign on the left up ahead, placed there by the Issaquah Alps Trail Club, proclaiming \"High School Trail.\"If, instead, you are beginning at the southern trailhead along 2nd Ave SE, just north of Front St, then head east on the obvious unsigned trail that leaves the parking area. Pass by some back yards and the soccer fields, and soon come to the same \"High School Trail\" sign that's encountered by folks coming from the northern trailhead.Where the sign indicates you should turn, drop a few feet then hike a gentle arc to the left. In about a hundred feet reach an old road bed and turn sharply right, heading uphill.You will pass an old metal gate that for many years was closed and had to be detoured around. Now (2016), it seems to be open all the time. About 400 feet beyond the gate, look downslope to the right of the trail and note an old metal bathtub, now partly filled with gravel. What its original purpose might have been no one today seems to know.Farther along, come to a sign board with cautions about bears (yes they're out here, but rarely seen) and on the other side of the board you'll find a Green Trails map showing many Tiger Mountain trails. A bit farther along there is a side trail on the left. Just pass it, and continue along the main trail.The trail begins to level out, and soon you will see a rustic sign on the left for the Adventure Trail. A bit farther along a small, quiet stream passes beneath the trail via a culvert. It comes from the direction of tiny Round Lake, and seems to run all year even in dry years.Shortly, you will find yourself beneath a major power line with a signpost located just a few feet to your left. The signpost marks the official upper end of the High School Trail, although the Poo Poo Point and Section Line Trails continue on from there. You can return the way you came, or can continue on one of the ongoing trails if that's your plan for the day.While the High School Trail is not really a wildflower hike, in spring it's likely you will see buttercups, salmon berry, thimble berry, avens, salal, white daisies, and sometimes even an odd trillium although they are more common higher up in the Tigers. A few low honeysuckle vines do grow along the High School Trail, but sightings of the small bright-orange trumpet blooms seem to be fairly rare (be alert if you are hiking in May.) Also, you are likely to see a few squirrels, and there have been reports of occasional deer sightings. You will hear many bird calls, although some birds will manage to remain out of sight.","driving_directions":"From I-90 (Exit 17) in Issaquah head south on Front Street through the picturesque old part of town.

And judging by how fast camping permits are snatched up for this area, it’s no secret.This trail can be engaged from a variety of starting points depending on time and interest. One popular starting point is the Wonderland Trail at Box Canyon, 10 miles west of the Stevens Canyon Entrance. The first mile is a moderate trek northeast to the Nickel Creek wilderness camp, followed by a vigorous 2,000-foot climb to the crest of the Cowlitz Divide. The trail undulates along the divide, meadows widening the higher you go, and eventually gains another 500 feet to views of Double and Shriner Peaks to the east and The Mountain rising immediately to the west. The trail then drops a quick 800 feet into the valley of the Ohanapecosh River and the wide meadows of Indian Bar. In early summer, numerous waterfalls stream down the walls of the valley, fed by the glaciers above. This makes a good halfway point before starting the next climb.From Indian Bar, the trail continues north, steeply climbing over 1,500 feet in the next 1.5 miles. It then levels somewhat while traversing the meadows of Ohanapecosh Park to the high point on the Wonderland: Panhandle Gap at 6,800 feet. Here you’ll find yourself in the alpine zone, a landscape dominated by rocky talus that often holds snow through the summer months. Rangers and guidebooks issue warnings about traversing the snowfields here in bad weather, so exercise caution and good judgement. This is a common location to spot mountain goats, and the Cowlitz Chimneys can be viewed to the east. From the gap, the trail descends 1.5 miles to the Summerland wilderness camp along Fryingpan Creek. Little Tahoma rises sharply above wide meadows brimming with wildflowers, and Goat Island Mountain dominates to the north. The route then descends steadily along Fryingpan Creek 4 miles to the trailhead at Sunrise Road.Extend Your Hike:  Consider camping at one or more of the four campsites in the area: Nickel Creek (four sites), Olallie Creek, Indian Bar (five sites, one group site), and Summerland (six sites). It can be tough to get permits at these campsites due to the area’s popularity and the fact that you’ll be competing with weekend hikers as well as advance-planning Wonderland Trail hikers for the handful of wilderness campsites available through this section. To improve your chances of scoring a permit and savoring this idyllic location, consider a midweek trip.","driving_directions":"From Elbe, head east on State Route 706 for 29 miles (SR 706 will turn into Paradise Road).

While the Grand Ridge trail starting from Obstruction Point is listed elsewhere on this website, the eastern half of the Grand Ridge Trail, starting from Deer Park, is listed here as a separate day hike to make the relevant information and trip reports easier to find.The trailhead is clearly marked “Obstruction Point Trail – Obstruction Point 7.6 m” on the west side of Deer Park Road just before the parking lot by the usually unstaffed Ranger Station.  The trail starts at approximately 5300 feet, descends through mixed forest to 4900 feet in the first half mile, then starts to climb to forest-clad Green Mountain. The trail passes at 5500 feet below the summit of Green Mountain (5622 feet), continuing through mixed subalpine forest. As you hike through the forest, there are occasionally views to the south, and later to the north, that give an inkling of the broader vistas to come. You may also notice an area of burnt forest adjoining the trail on the south side –- it is more obvious on the return than on the outward journey.  As you traverse Green Mountain, the forest occasionally opens to small meadows with blueberries and wildflowers. Finally the forest ends and you enter the broad meadows of Maiden Peak with grasses and wildflowers. Fantastic views in all directions now start to open up with every step. To the north and northeast are the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Vancouver Island, Canadian peaks, and Mount Baker and Mount Shuksan hovering like a shimmering mirage over the hulk of nearby Blue Mountain. You can look back over the forest of Green Mountain and see the scar of Deer Park Road on Blue Mountain.Straight ahead as you emerge from the forest is a rocky peak, the first sub-peak (6319 feet) of Maiden Peak. The trail traverses the meadow to the south of this peak, with views of the tree-clad valleys and ridges below including Grand Lake and Grand Valley, and a panorama of the Olympic mountains to the south, including The Needles, Deception Peak, Mount Cameron, and Elk Mountain. To the east, Glacier Peak towers over the Cascades.  As you round the first sub-peak, you now see the second, true summit of Maiden Peak (6434 feet). The trail traverses 200 feet below this peak on the south side. There is no official trail or sign to get to the top and the wildflower meadows are fragile to degradation if people go off-trail. There is a faint boot path that people have used to scramble to the top. The summit is marked by a USGS survey marker. Caution is required given the steep cliffs on the north to northeast side of the peak. Once at the top, the views are all-round and even more expansive. For those who turn back from this point, the hike is 7.1 miles round trip.It is worth continuing on the main trail past the third sub-peak (6380 feet) of Maiden Peak and descend to the saddle between Maiden Peak and Elk Mountain. This has especially spectacular views of the north face of Elk Mountain, and a closer look south into Grand Valley. There is a short section of narrow trail across a steep scree slope that may be challenging for acrophobes, but those who persevere will find the sign for Roaring Winds camp (6000 feet) at the lowest point of the saddle. From here one can look up to the Grand Ridge trail winding up the steep slopes of Elk Mountain, as well as look north to Mount Angeles, Klahhane Ridge, Hurricane Ridge Road and the strait of Juan de Fuca. Roaring Winds (4.5 miles) provides a satisfying point for day hikers to turn back and enjoy this hike’s spectacular views from the other direction.Wildlife sightings reported for this hike include horned larks, hawks, chipmunks, marmots, deer, and bears.  There is no water on the trail, and a large part of the trail is exposed, so bring plenty of water.","driving_directions":"Driving on route 101 going west from Sequim, turn left on Deer Park Road.

You can even use this trail as the jumpoff (or ending point) to a variety of longer hikes out of the Elwha River Valley.With expansive views of the Bailey Range right from the parking area, hikers will not be bored here. Follow the wide pathway along a south-facing traverse, first through open forests of pines and low shrubs. The way eventually opens up to a moderately graded traverse. The way is quite easy to navigate, since the trail is wide. It consists of three generous switchbacks to a summit complete with interpretive signs pointing out the visible peaks and towns, as well as the various burns that have come through this area. Just before the first switchback, encounter a trenched trail (which is signed ‘Elwha 6 mi’) heading off to your left. This trail accesses the Elwha River Valley and the Whiskey Bend Road. It makes for quite a steep, challenging round trip day hike of 14 miles, so unless you have plenty of time to spare (or a car waiting at the other end), continue on the main trail. Switchback up and up, on a somewhat steeper grade than the first part of the trail, through golden grasses to the summit of Hurricane Hill. The place is aptly named. Located in such an exposed section of Olympic National Park, weather and winds can whip up quickly here, so be sure to have your windbreaker. From the top, take in views of the craggy Bailey Range to the south, often spangled with snow well into summer. North is the town of Port Angeles and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Across the water, Vancouver Island. Occasionally ferries are visible here, shuttling people back and forth between the US and Canada.

This is the only trail granting access to Spirit’s shoreline view of Mount St. Helens from across the altered lake’s log-jammed waters. And the falls? They’re gone—submerged after the eruption that dammed the lake’s outlet, causing its water level to rise by over 250 feet. All that remains of Harmony Falls now is a small set of smaller, melodious cascades.Immediately descend as you hike through a tunnel of alders. As in other parts of the blast zone, the rate and amount of forest regeneration going on here is remarkable. Come back in a few years for a completely different experience. At about 0.4 mile, the way wiggles beneath some overhanging ledges dripping with moisture and creating a lush grotto.The way bends right to eventually emerge upon an open plain plush with wildflowers. The path then bends left, traversing ledge striated by past glaciers and scoured clean of vegetation in 1980 by the massive eruption-caused landslide that plunged into the lake, creating a monstrous wave over 800 feet high. Forests hundreds of years old were immediately toppled—and thousands of fallen giants were swept to the lake, where they now float in massive logjams.As it nears the lake, the trail winds down ledge, brushing against a small creek cascading over polished rock. This small chute is now referred to as Harmony Falls. The original Harmony Falls were impressively big and tumbled through big timber to the lake near a rustic lodge. Harmony Falls Lodge, along with the falls and several other lodges and camps, are all gone now, their original locations submerged under 250 feet of water.At 1.2 miles, the trail ends at the log-lined lake (elev. 3410 ft). The logs shift with the winds and can be dangerous—use caution around them. Do enjoy the great views though across the lake to Mount St. Helens, the Pumice Plain, Harry’s Ridge, and Coldwater Peak.

About three-quarters of a mile in, you'll reach the base of those switchbacks and head up. Take your time and enjoy the ever-improving view of the Tatoosh Range. You'll begin to see the Paradise Inn and Visitors Center as well, and of course, the massif of Rainier looming ever larger. The \"golden gate\" that this hike is named for is the viewpoint at the junction with the Skyline Trail. Here there is a flat spot where you can sit and enjoy the views, but they only improve if you continue up the Skyline Trail.

From the Glacier Basin trailhead in the White River Campground, the 3.25-mile hike up along the Inter Fork of the White River is a breeze thanks to the recent trail restoration done by WTA and the National Park Service.Along the way, a 0.5-mile side trail heads up Emmons Moraine and offers incredible views of Emmons Glacier, the largest sheet of ice on Rainier, and a milky blue-green glacial lake below. Another mile up, pass the junction with the Burroughs Mountain Trail and continue to the Glacier Basin wilderness camp in a forested glen. Just beyond the camp, Glacier Basin opens up in all its glory, with wide meadows, a large shimmering tarn, and views up The Mountain of The Wedge and Mount Ruth.

Cross a shallow saddle, then mount the final distance amid wide-open alpine plains. The view from 7,400-foot Burroughs Mountain reaches west to the Olympics, north to Glacier Peak and the North Cascades, and southward, where Rainier is all encompassing.

It is a great option for beginner hikers looking to up their hiking game as well as those looking for exceptional mountain views without the mileage and time commitment of a longer hike.Starting at the shared trailhead for Blue Lake Trail 604, head into the forest teeming with pacific silver fir, subalpine fir, and mountain hemlock. The trail is straightforward and easy to follow— clear dirt paths alternate with more eroded and rubbled sections. Partridgefoot, a fanciful semi-shrub that looks a bit like parsley, peeks up from the ground, as well as deer fern and haircap moss.In about a quarter mile, come to a signed intersection that splits left for Blue Lake and right for Dock Butte. Head right towards Dock Butte and continue climbing upwards through a particularly rocky patch of trail to your reward: Mount Baker peeking through the trees— just a taste of the views to come.Continuing on, pause as each small break in the forest reveals clearer and clearer views of Mount Baker and her subpeaks: Colfax Peak and Lincoln Peak. Gradually emerge into open, grassy meadows with small tarns dotting the way. Spot Sitka mountain-ash, a deciduous plant whose jagged-edged leaves turn a bright magenta, orange, and yellow in the fall.At about the 2.0 mile mark, the trail forks. To your left is a direct scramble route to the summit, and to the right is a milder trail that gently switchbacks up the northern side of Dock Butte. Either trail will get you there; it’s your preference which one to take. The milder trail rejoins the scramble route just below the summit.The 360 degree views from the summit of Dock Butte are simply spectacular. Mount Baker is the brightest star in a constellation of peaks visible to you on a clear day, including Mount Shuksan, Glacier Peak, Sloan Peak, Whitehorse Mountain, Three Fingers, Mount Rainier, Mount Angeles, Hurricane Hill, Twin Sisters, and Loomis Mountain. The clear, turquoise waters of Baker Lake stretch out to the east, as well as the verdant Skagit Valley to the south. Enjoy your lunch or snack in the company of these fine landmarks, and marvel at how a fire lookout, built in the mid-1930s, once stood in this very spot until the early 1960s.WTA Pro Tip: Even though the trail is relatively short, pack hiking poles, sun protection, and plenty of water. The trail is a bit roughed-up in stretches and poles will help navigate these areas. It is also very exposed the last mile to the summit, so a hat and sunscreen will come in handy as well as plenty of water.Extend Your Hike: Make your hike a two-for-one by checking out Blue Lake on your way back to the trailhead.

Believed to be the first park in the United States to be co-owned and managed by a tribe and another government, management of the area focuses on conservation and research, public education and limited recreational use, including hiking.The preserve includes 84 acres on Kiket Island and Flagstaff Point and 9 acres on Fidalgo Island, all of which are located within the Swinomish Reservation. Here, cattail mats were once used as temporary summer shelters by the local tribe during clam digs and salmon seining. More than two miles of shoreline play host to native eelgrass beds, multiple fish species and shellfish. The preserve's diverse land habitats also house several endangered or threatened species, and a \"rocky bald\" -- an area with fragile, thin soil -- provides land for yet more native plants and waterfowl. The fragility of the land on the rocky bald dictates that access to Flagstaff Point be prohibited to protect the unique life that inhabits this area. But there are opportunities for hikers to enjoy this area. Two miles of walking trails currently exist, with plans to add an ADA-accessible boardwalk, another trail and amenities such as a picnic shelter, picnic sites, interpretive information and two vault restrooms.Start your exploration from the parking area by taking the gravel Kiket Trail as it crosses a tombolo (a sand spit connecting an island to the mainland) to Kiket Island. Pass Kiket Lagoon and look northwest to Fidalgo Island, where Mount Erie looms in the distance. The Kiket Trail bisects Kiket Island and is the most direct route to Kiket's west side. For a lollipop loop, follow this road to a signed intersection and turn right for the North Trail. The singletrack North Trail has some elevation gain but is gentle enough for young hikers. At its high point, a meadow overlook provides views of Deception Pass Bridge, framed by madrona boughs and old growth. From here the trail descends to a large meadow at the west end of Kiket Island, meeting up once more with the Kiket Trail. Continue west to find a second tombolo leading out to Flagstaff Point. This shoreline offers windswept views of Skagit and Hope Islands, as well as Similk Bay.Home to a delicate meadow ecosystem, Flagstaff Point was—amazingly—formerly proposed as the site of a nuclear power plant by Seattle City Light. Head back along the gentle South Trail, peeking out at tiny High Tide Island's single tree from meadow balds. Meet the Kiket Trail one more time and returnto the parking area.The preserve is open daily for day use only, from dawn to dusk. A parking lot at the entrance is available for easy access to the preserve. Please note: Dogs are not allowed at the preserve.","driving_directions":"From Highway 20, turn south on Reservation Road for 1.5 mi. Turn right on Snee Oosh Road for 1.4 mi.

This wildlife sanctuary is just minutes from downtown Olympia, featuring an 800 acre site that protects habitat for marine shoreline animals along five miles of shoreline in South Puget Sound. In addition, it is home to a maturing second growth forest, protected from logging activities.After parking by a seasonal boat-launch, walk down the old road to this habitat-protected area. Turn left about 100 feet from the beginning of the road to take a winding, forested 1.5 mile loop trail which rejoins the road just a little farther down or continue on the road to get to the viewpoint. Along the road, watch for a variety of young native trees planted by conservation groups that have worked on the site. After three-quarters of a mile,the mostly-unused road stops at a sheltered picnic area. Take a moment to sit and read the signs to learn about the area’s natural history. From here, choose to turn left or right to look out over either side of Woodard Bay’s little peninsula. To the right is a small southeast-facing lookout with a couple of sturdy benches. To the left on the northern side of the peninsula, admire the old railroad track pier that was once used to transfer logs on their way to mills 90 miles to the North. Now the dilapidated pier is home to a colony of yuma myotis bats, and thousands of pregnant females aggregate at the pier each spring to give birth. Although this is a seemingly perfect habitat for the bats, the old pier was treated with creosote, which contains chemicals that could harm the wetlands and shoreline ecosystem. Washington State DNR is currently working to keep the bats’ habitat while getting rid of the chemicals, and half the pier has been removed to protect the area. Woodard Bay is home to another animal, too: harbor seals. The old log booms are now used as a haul-out site for seals -- a place for them to hang out, warm up, and relax out of the water. Most importantly, this protected area provides a place where the seals can give birth each summer. The seals share their old log booms with purple martins, which nest in boxes attached to the log booms.History of the area: The site is valuable anthropologically, as well, with a rich and varied human history, including Native Americans, early settlers, and the logging and shellfish industries. The first people to settle the area were the Woodard family. They arrived in 1853, farmed the land, and built a house. As more settlers pushed into the region during the 19th century, Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens was commissioned to negotiate with tribes now known as Squaxin Island, Nisqually, Puyallup, and Muckleshoot for a treaty. The Treaty of Medicine Creek was signed December 26, 1854. The Native Americans gave up 400,000 acres of land and agreed to live on reservations with the promise of certain rights. However, when these promises went unkept war broke out in 1855, and the Woodard family moved into Olympia. For the next half-century ownership of this land changed many times, but in January of 1900, Frederick Weyerhaeuser and a group of lumberman bought Woodard Bay along with 900,000 acres of land. After changing ownership many times, the land was eventually sold back to the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company. Beginning in 1928 shipments of logs were transferred at the railroad pier. Finally the business began to decline in 1979, and the Natural Resources Conservation Areas Act was passed in 1987, allowing Washington State to purchase the land for restoration.If you still want more of this Conservation Area, drive back down Woodard Bay Road about a half mile to the Chehalis Western Trail. Starting there, follow a one mile crushed-rock (barrier free) trail that leads to a lookout point at the end. This trail is closed from March to mid-August to protect nesting birds, such as one of the most significant heron rookeries in the state.WTA Pro Tip: Don’t disturb seal pups that are resting on the beach! Their parents appreciate it when humans observe the pups from a distance.","driving_directions":"From I-5 heading south, take Exit 109 (Martin Way Exit) towards Sleater-Kinney Road, and make a right onto Sleater-Kinney Rd NE.

Birds are abundant on the wetlands, and the forest is lush, with large, second-growth trees, a testament to the effort that several groups have put into managing this forest in order to restore the health of this area.Thanks to work from the Friends of Island Center Forest, the Vashon Forest Stewards, Vashon-Maury Island Land Trust, and Vashon-Maury Island Audubon, this nature preserve offers a network of forest trails to residents of (and visitors to) Vashon and Maury Island. There are several park entrances; the closest to the town of Vashon is from SW 188th St, the turn-off for which is just a half-mile south of the intersection in \"downtown\" Vashon. From this trailhead, complete with picnic benches and shelters, as well as maps of the preserve, it's an easy walk to Mukai Pond, a lovely wetland ringed with beautiful, colorful willows.The westside entrance is a wide spot in the road, but don't let the nearby restored Borrow Pit or the landfill next door stop you from heading into the park! After stopping to admire the great restoration work on the borrow pit, you'll soon be in lush forest--hushed, save for birds and squirrels. You will forget you're at a County park.A third access point is the Cemetary Trailhead, accessible from 115th Ave SW off SW Cemetary Road. This trailhead is more convenient for island locals, while visitors to Vashon will probably opt for the 118th St. entrance. There are 10 miles of trail at Island Center Forest, plenty of opportunity to wander to your heart's content. But be sure to take a map; there are some confusing intersections, though many are signed. And of course, as with any park adjacent to a neighborhood, there are many waytrails leading to homes. Having a map will help you avoid wandering into someone's backyard. Some trails can be quite muddy on a rainy day, and during the rainiest months, it is not possible to approach the walks at Mukai Pond or Meadowdale Pond, due to high water. If this is the case, go back another time!Watch for bicyclists and equestrians, and remember that this is a working forest, with recovery in process, so there may be trail closures. WTA Pro Tip: Consider making this a bike trip! It costs less to take a bike on the Fauntleroy Ferry, and the RapidRide C Line makes a stop at the terminal. From the Vashon terminal, huff and puff up the admittedly steep hill or hop on the bus. The bus stops just north of town, where you can bike to the turnoff at 188th St SW. If you're riding the whole way, know that the turnoff is 5.4 miles from the terminal. Trails in the park are bike friendly, or you can lock up your bike and hike. Afterwards, you can coast back through town, stopping for a bite to eat at Dragonfly Cafe and a browse at the bookstore. When you're ready to head home, hop on your bike and cruise back down to the ferry terminal.","driving_directions":"From West Seattle, take the ferry to Vashon Island.

The morning opening hour is not specified, so perhaps \"dawn\" is intended.The Preserve offers a 1.2 mile loop trail that is nearly level, having an elevation change less than 50 feet. For a map, see the Trail Maps link at www.sammamishwalks.org. While Beaver Lake provides the southern boundary of the Beaver Lake Preserve, the loop trail is strictly a forest trail and does not include any of the lakeshore.The loop trail passes through moist forest with a lot of very large trees, both deciduous and coniferous. A few well weathered stumps hint at the size of trees earlier loggers harvested here. The stumps seem no larger than the bases of the largest trees you see today, so perhaps some old growth does remain in the park.While the loop trail has no lake of its own there are areas of standing water, and hanging moss and ferns are everywhere. You are likely to hear frogs, and perhaps the call of a raven or a woodpecker. A sign at the trailhead indicates there have been occasional black bear sightings, so stay alert. In season you may see a few wildflowers including trillium, Oregon grape, salmonberry, miner's lettuce and a lot of skunk cabbage. Begin your hike by heading north from the parking area on the obvious trail. After 600 feet or so any equestrians or bikers are shunted off onto a separate trail that leads to Soaring Eagle Regional Park. The ongoing Beaver Lake Preserve trail veers sharply left, and is signed for foot traffic only. A few bikers seem to find this change confusing, and you might see occasional bike tracks in soft sections of the ongoing loop trail.Part way around the loop, a connecting trail leads to the nearby Hazel Wolf Wetlands Preserve that has a loop of its own.

This generally means keeping to the edges of the groomed trails and yielding right of way to skiers. As most of the trails do double duty as logging roads in the summer, there is plenty of room for all to enjoy the gently rolling terrain come winter. Follow the signs to Forest Road 92 which leads to “North District“ snow parks and the trailhead to Copper Creek. The distance to the hut depends as there are several snow parks which give access to the trail depending snow conditions at various altitudes. The lower the snow line, the longer the distance to the hut. Plan on a minimum of a nine mile round trip hike and note that Washington non-motorized Snow Park Permits are required at all the parking areas. The Copper Creek trail itself is great for families and beginner skiers and snowshoers. You will find the terrain mostly forested and gentle rolling hills gaining just over 1,000 feet of elevation over the distance from the most commonly used snowpark trailhead to the hut. The trail is well marked and along the way passes several trail junctions  which lead to loop trails which can be explored by the more adventuresome. Sightings of wildlife along the trail are common. During the day, the heated hut, with it’s well appointed kitchen and outdoor restroom is open to the public and frequently staffed with volunteer ski patrollers on weekends. Overnight stays at the huts can be arranged with reservations and a nominal charge for a permit.

Note that although the campsites here don't require reservations, space is limited. Campsite 13.1 has room for a double tent with no vestibules and 13.2 has room for only a single tent, while 13.3 can accommodate a double tent plus a small single.From any of these sites, it's possible to make the hike to Blue Glacier in just one day. There is one more stopping spot, Elk Lake, which shortens your day hiking distance to the glacier, but would make for a long approach on your way in. It is 17.5 miles to your first glimpse of the glacier, and another mile to the best viewpoint. Wherever you elect to set up camp, be sure to allow plenty of time to admire the glacier when you do decide to head there. Hikers are frequently struck by the majesty of its endless blue-tinged crevasses. The panorama includes a sweeping sight of the entire glacier, from the dome of Olympus to the moraine, a truly spectacular sight. On your return to camp, enjoy views of the mountains lining the long valley ahead of you, which houses and the headwaters of the Hoh River. Peer at the White Glacier, whose clifflike snout allows a waterfall to go plunging into the outflow from Blue Glacier. In 1812, the two glaciers were merged at Elk Lake. Note how far the glacier has receded in just 200 years, and imagine where it might be in another 200.

The lush riparian vegetation of cottonwoods, aspens, water birches, willows, oaks, and deciduous shrubs is as colorful as anything you’ll find anywhere—and a fantastic location for fall photography. This gentle trail follows the south side of the Tieton River from the Oak Creek Wildlife Area Visitor Center.

Cross the river on a footbridge to connect to the trail, and turn left. The route cuts across the hillside directly above the river, then drops into a giant meadow ringed with cottonwoods, Garry oaks, aspens, red-osier dogwoods and wild roses.Leaving the meadow behind, the trail winds up and down through the floodplain, immersed in lush riparian vegetation. At just the right time of fall, this portion of the trail can be an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of yellow, gold, bronze, maroon, red, orange and green. After about 1.5 miles, the trail reaches a suspension bridge and shortly beyond climbs to a broad sagebrush flat. The next 1.8 miles to the visitor center winds through dry sagebrush, away from the river.

When the Yakima Basalt Formation--a series of lava flows with sediment deposits--covered the area. Devil Creek eventually eroded these deposits, causing sediment to collapse and the caves to form. A short hike to the natural wonders left behind by the erosion process makes this trail popular on summer weekends.The trail to Boulder Cave was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1930s and has been improved several times since then, most recently in 2014. The trail is signed as the Sun and Sage loop and it follows a small ravine. Make sure to keep an eye out for the lookout platform over the gorge just after the first hill. The path climbs gradually with a number of interpretive signs about the local ecology and history along the way.As the trail flattens out, look to the far side of the ravine to see a new cave beginning to form. Then wind your way down to the the cave entrance. This cave formation is more of a tunnel so the trail through is one way, follow the sign to the right and the cave entrance. If you plan to walk through the cave don't forget a light source or two. Also this area is important habitat for the Pacific western big-eared bat, please follow these guidelines to reduce disturbance to this sensitive species:Limit all noise (whisper)Stay on trail Don't touch the cave wallsDirect light beam at the trail, avoid directing it at the ceilingRespect the seasonal closureAfter you have explored this small cave (about 400 feet deep) you will pop out the backside and meet up with the trail.

The way is rocky from start to finish, lined with lupine and sedges, and patches of blueberries. There is very little shade. Total elevation gain is moderate, but the mile-high altitude can be a factor if you are not acclimatized.From the northwest corner of the large parking lot at Artist Point, start out on the Chain Lakes Trail. At 1.1 miles is a junction. Go straight to start on the Ptarmigan Ridge trail. Crest over a ridge then drop 200 feet (now lower than the parking lot), to pass below a rugged rock face, then reattain the ridge on the far side.Contour below the ridge top on the southeast side, climbing gently for half a mile, through a talus slope that often holds snow late into the season. At 2.9 miles, crest over the ridge at 5630 feet and change directions from southeast to due west. Weather permitting, Coleman Pinnacle and Mount Baker dominate the view to the west. The visible trail shows a continuing gentle ascent.Pass beneath Coleman Pinnacle on slopes that usually retain snow patches late into the season, arriving at a junction 3.8 miles from the trailhead and at 5950 feet. The views here are fantastic, making this a popular resting spot and the destination for many day hikers.To the south is beautiful green Goat Lake. The large plateau leading to the lake offers camping when water is available. But the trail down (once melted out) is loose, gravelly, and treacherous for the first 500 feet.Should you go further? From here, the trail changes abruptly, both in direction and in character. It turns right, getting narrower and steeper as it climbs quickly to 6100 feet. Then it drops slightly over the next half mile, passing nondescript Camp Kiser along the way.You can glimpse The Portals, the prominent rock formations known to climbers of Mount Baker’s northeast side, and access for the Park Glacier climbing route. At 4.5 miles and 5970 feet is a plateau suitable for camping, and what maps show as the end of the trail.Beyond the plateau, a primitive boot trail continues up the rocky hill: East Peak (also known as The Portals East). It does not lead to climbing routes, but rather climbs above them to 6500 feet over 1.1 miles, fanning out into numerous social trails before dead-ending at a precipice with sheer drops. The up-close views are outstanding, but the path requires route-finding skills and possibly mountaineering experience (depending on snow conditions). Each hiker must decide where their stopping point is, before returning the way them came.Note: The term “The Portals” is used to identify the rock formations flanking the climbers’ route. But they are also known by various names and compass directions, such as “West Portal” or “The Portals South” or “Portals East Peak”.","driving_directions":"From I-5 exit 255, go east 34 miles on SR 542 to the town of Glacier.

Along with unobstructed panoramic views of Mount Baker, the Twin Sisters, and the rest of the North Cascades, the route to Park Butte offers campsites, wildflower-filled alpine meadows, rushing waterfalls, and a stunning variety of mushroom species.Park Butte is one of the most popular Mount Baker area hikes for a variety of reasons: unobstructed mountain views, a moderately steep trail with access to campsites, and an open, maintained historic fire lookout built in 1932. The Forest Service now uses advanced technology to search for fires, but decades ago fire lookouts proliferated on the peaks of the Cascades. One of the few remaining intact lookouts is on Park Butte; it is maintained through the volunteer efforts of the Skagit Alpine Club.The trail leaves the parking area at 3250 feet of elevation and heads west, crossing a bridge over Sulphur Creek and passing through Schrieber’s Meadow. At 0.1 mile, on the right, is the first intersection with the Scott Paul Trail. Continue left through the meadow, enjoying wildflower overload in the summer and a berry bonanza in the autumn; species that grow here include heather, salmonberry, blueberry, huckleberry, fireweed, lupine, and pearly everlasting. As you ascend with rushing Sulphur Creek and its waterfalls on your right, see how many mushrooms you can identify; a partial list includes yellow cracked bolete, peppery bolete, blackfoot paxillus, northern Russula, sharp-scaled lepiota, deadly lepiota, and fly amanita. WTA has performed trailwork here, building puncheon to maintain a trail through myriad rivulets of the boggy meadow.After 0.7 miles, leave the meadow to cross Rocky Creek and the boulder fields through which it passes. Sometimes a ladder bridge is necessary to cross the main “channel,” which frequently changes position. Note that cairns may mark the locations where you should enter and leave the boulder fields. Once across Rocky Creek, the terrain changes as you enter old-growth forest, and the grade stiffens a bit. Take in the mountain hemlocks and yellow cedar that surround you as you switchback up and to the northwest. At two miles, you reach the second junction with the Scott Paul Trail, at 4400 feet. Continue left, and enter Morovitz Meadow, where Koma Kulshan presides over fields of heather, mountain ash, wildflower, and vaccinia berry bushes that blaze flaming red in fall.In 0.4 miles come to the junction with the Railroad Grade Trail, which leads to the Easton Glacier and is a frequently-used route for summiting Baker. Stay left and descend to Bell Pass Junction, passing through boggy meadows. After 0.6 miles keep left and ascend again for 0.7 miles over rocky tread to Park Butte, which now dominates the view opposite Koma Kulshan. Skirt boulder fields as pika brashly squeak “eep!” at passersby. On your left, pass—or visit—a series of tarns that reflect the summit block of Baker on clear days. Just before you make the final push to the lookout, take in Pocket Lake below you and to the southeast.When you reach the lookout, at 5450 feet elevation, take care as you climb the ladder. Sign the lookout register, or even pen an entry in the poetry register. Gnarled mountain hemlocks, subalpine fir, and noble fir surround the lookout. Directly north are the Black Buttes, Lincoln and Colfax. To the southwest are the Twin Sisters, and the Nooksack River valley heads west to the horizon. And if the fates favor you with a sunny day, bask in the views of the sheer white glaciers of Koma Kulshan.WTA Pro Tip: first-come, first-served camping overnight is available in the fire lookout.

The lake in a rocky basin, in the midst of this spectacular scenery. On some days you can hear ice echoing through the valley as it crashes down the face of Mount Shuksan. This is a late season hike, as snow can linger here into August.The trail begins just below Artist Point and is well marked from a paved parking lot. Start your hike by descending on switchbacks through sub-alpine forest. Soon you will reach a sign indicating you are entering the Mt. Baker Wilderness.After entering the wilderness, the trail briefly opens up to a picturesque alpine basin. As you descend, the trail levels out and you hike through boulder fields, dried-up creek beds, meadows, wildflowers, and clear running streams. This area is part of the headwaters of Swift Creek. As you look ahead of you, you will see Mount Shuksan and your destination across the basin. On your left is Shuksan Arm.Up to this point in the hike the trail can be rocky and root filled, but soon you will enter sub-alpine forest on an easy, level, and well maintained trail, catching peek-a-boo glimpses of Baker and Shuksan. The trail briefly breaks out into the open right before the Swift Creek trailhead. Here there is a privy available and you can see the unmaintained Swift Creek trail on your right. From this junction, you will start ascending, re-entering sub-alpine forest with views of Mount Baker.After re-emerging from the forest, look across the basin at your starting point. Here you'll have views of Artist Point, the Ptarmigan Ridge Trail, and spectacular views of Baker. Continue ascending on talus slopes, heather meadows, and rocky basins, listening for the squeak of pikas and whistles from marmots. Enjoy wildflower displays that surround you as your views of Baker start to recede. But never fear--soon you'll see the tops of Mount Shuksan and Fisher Chimney on your approach to the saddle above Lake Ann. The approach before the saddle can hold snowfields until well into August, so be prepared for snow travel.Peer down at Lake Ann from the saddle. As you continue down, Lake Ann will be on your right and you will come to a 'T'. The trail to the right will lead down to Lake Ann, complete with camping spots and a climber's path that will take you to the foot of Lower Curtis Glacier; the Fisher Chimney climbing route for Mount Shuksan. The real prize at this junction of the trail is directly in front of you, though--an up-close and personal view of the west face of Mount Shuksan. Take in this awe-inspiring sight before continuing down to the lake or take the path to Lower Curtis Glacier.If you continue to Curtis Glacier, you will enter North Cascades National Park. As you skirt around the end of the valley you'll enjoy a view of Baker Lake on your right and another camping opportunity on the left.WTA Pro Tip: Lake Ann is a great hike, but due to the incredible views and relatively moderate trail, it can be quite crowded.

Wait until later in the hiking season though, as this area is known for its bugs.Begin hiking through a beautiful forest of second-growth hemlock. Boardwalks help keep your feet dry and add interest for younger hikers. After approximately a mile of hiking, arrive in a pretty meadow, where you'll find a signed junction for Anderson Butte. This 1.5 mile side trip is a steep hike, but well-shaded, and worth the sweat expended to achieve the summit, offering views of Mounts Baker and Shuksan. Take the side trip if you like, or continue right, though the meadow where several varieties of wildflowers bloom in August. Cross a small stream, and climb gradually up the meadow. Look behind you periodically, there is an excellent view of Mount Baker.At the top of the meadow, enter a beautiful forest draped in moss.

The nearby Ape Cave and the Trail of Two Forests both provide welcome respite from the typically hot and dry hikes around St. Helens. The Ape Caves weave underground through old lava tubes, while the Trail of Two Forests shows the volcano's power, contrasting old-growth forest with the devastated landscape that didn't escape the 1980 explosion. Now the new Volcano View Trail offers hikers of every age a mile-long nature trail that curves around stumps, boulders and hemlocks.A thick green canopy of trees high above the trail shades hikers, keeping it considerably cooler on the hike, even when tempuratures soar in midsummer. The trail follows an old logging road, though it may be hard to tell. Trees have grown up over many sections of trail, and WTA volunteers worked hard to create a more natural experience for hikers as they built the trail over several years. From the trailhead, follow a gentle uphill grade to a flat section near some old-growth nurse logs. Kids will marvel at the western hemlock saplings that spring from the ancient stumps. This twist in the trail was intentional. WTA and land managers who laid out the trail wanted to show hikers a glimpse of the future; the saplings of today could be the magnificent trees of tomorrow. Past the nurse stumps, the trail traverses a hillside and passes over some mossy boulders. There's an open area here that can be used for picnicking, snacking, or simply a rest before continuing just a few minutes further to the south view of the volcano. Don't be surprised by the small parking lot nearby. WTA volunteers completed a wheel-chair friendly trail from the upper parking area to the viewpoint in 2014, and the parking lot is currently available for those who don't have the time for a mile-long walk in the woods.","driving_directions":"From Cougar, head east on Forest Road 90.

This hike is very challenging, with sparse camps, little water and some sketchy sections of loose pumice. Since the eruption denuded the slopes of the mountain, you’re almost always in sun, so make sure you wear your hat and bring sunscreen. It is all too easy to get a severe sunburn on these slopes.With those cautions in mind, you’ll fully appreciate the stark, otherworldly beauty of the blast zone. Vast fields of pumice gouged with deep gullies frame the gaping immensity of the mountain.  There are multiple points where you can access the Loowit, here are four of the most commonly used access points. (If you want a taste of the Loowit without the full meal deal, each of these hikes is a great way to sample the mountain.)Windy RidgeFollow the Truman Trail (#207) for approx. 3 miles, then take the Windy Trail (#216E) for another 1 mile to the Loowit (#216). This route will take you closest to “The Breach” and Loowit Falls. Note that camping is not allowed in the blast zone which includes the northern portion of the mountain between the South Fork of the Toutle River and Windy Pass.Ape Canyon TrailheadPark at the Ape Canyon Trailhead and go 5.5 miles on the Ape Canyon Trail (#234) to the junction with the Loowit (#216). Turn right (north) and hike another mile or two across the spectacular Plains of Abraham. Note this route is very popular with mountain bikers.Climber’s BivouacTake the Ptarmigan Trail (#216A) 2 miles to the junction with the Loowit (#216). Turn left or right to experience the Loowit as it skirts the treeline along the volcano’s southern flank.Blue Lake TrailheadFollow the Toutle Trail (#238) for about 3 miles. Ascend the Sheep Canyon Trail (#240) 2.5 miles to the Loowit. You can make a nice lollipop loop by following the Loowit another 2.5 miles north to its intersection with the terminus of the Toutle Trail, then following the Toutle Trail approx 5 miles back to the Blue Lake Trailhead. Circumnavigating Mount St. HelensSome recommend starting from the south at Climber’s Bivouac while others chose to start on the NE side from Windy Ridge. In either case you need to plan on crossing the blast zone in one push as camping is prohibited between the South Fork of the Toutle River and Windy Pass.  Since the most rugged section is on the west side where major washouts require extensive detours and/or scrambles, plan your trip to hit those sections when you are relatively fresh.Although each year hikers do complete the Loowit, others have turned back unable to find safe passage through some of the gullies. Since conditions change so frequently and people’s route finding ability and tolerance for risk vary, it is impossible to predict if the circumnavigation is “doable” at any given time for any hiker.This route description is for a counter-clockwise circumnavigation hike starting from the north side where the Windy Trail (#216E) meets the Loowit. Your first seven miles will afford near constant views of denuded slopes as you cross the blast zone looking into “The Breach”.  A short side-trail to Loowit Falls is a worthwhile break.  As you come around the mountain to the NW, the route drops into the valley carved by the South Fork of the Toutle.  Here the trail is frequently obliterated by the river and sliding loose rock and pumice. Crossing this gully is the first of three major wash-outs on the route.Continuing on the Loowit, the trail climbs up into remnant old growth forest on Crescent Ridge, and then enters a zone of burned trees and flower-rife meadows. You’ll enter subalpine forest, the trail climbing and falling until it again ascends to timberline near 4,700 ft.  About a ½ mile beyond the junction with the Sheep Canyon Trail the Loowit was obliterated by a washout in the Blue Lake Wash, leaving a huge chasm with near vertical walls in its place. The Forest Service completed a bypass route that adds another few miles, but it is much safer than attempting to scramble through the massive gully.Next, you’ll reach the junction with the Butte Camp Trail #238A. You can drop steeply along this trail—roughly 800 feet—to Butte Camp, if you need to make camp.Most of the trail from here on in is rugged as it runs through several lava beds, sometimes with nothing but posts or cairns to show the way.  After crossing Swift Creek (the winter climbing route), there is one more lava bed crossing to the junction with the June Lake Trail. For a pleasant campsite, follow the steep June Lake Trail (#216B) ¼ mile to its namesake lake. Continuing around the SE side of the Mountain you will encounter the 3rd major washout on the Loowit at Muddy Creek. It is approx. 4 miles from the June Lake Trail junction. Like the previous two washed out sections, the steep canyon walls and loose rock make it difficult and dangerous to scramble through the chasm.  WTA volunteer Backcountry Response Teams restored a badly washed-out section here in 2010.You’ll traverse more lava on the 4.75 miles to the Ape Canyon Trail.  Some of the best wild flowers are at the top of the canyon north of Pumice Butte. You finally have 4 miles of relatively smooth trail across the Plains of Abraham, then up Windy Pass and back to the intersection of the Windy Trail (#216). From there you’re on familiar terrain following the Truman Trail (#207) back to Windy Ridge.NOTE:  Trip mileage does not include required approach trails to the loop.

Regardless of season, this trail is a good introduction to the trails at Mount Spokane State Park.From the switchback parking lot approximately 1.5 miles beyond the park entrance, enter the trail system via the gated Mount Kit Carson Loop Road, an old roadbed now converted to park trail. Travel the old road for a mere 100 feet and take the first right onto Trail 100. Walk for approximately 200 feet and bear left at the next intersection as Trail 100 crosses Burping Brook for the first time on the bridge installed as part of an ongoing WTA project in the summer of 2013 and 2014.At the next intersection, bear right and continue uphill as Trail 110 joins Trail 100 for a short segment. After 0.4 miles, veer left on Trail 100 as Trail 110 continues uphill towards Saddle Junction. Just past the intersection, the trail crosses a second WTA-built bridge over another tributary of Burping Brook. As you hike, note the springboard slots on 6-foot tall stumps along this portion of the trail, marking a century-old logging operation that may have been part of the effort to rebuild Spokane in the wake of the massive 1889 fire. The trail now meanders along through the deep forest, generally losing elevation over approximately .3 miles to the next intersection. Continue to the right on trail 100 and begin to climb again as the trail contours across the hillside for about a mile, crossing two additional tributaries of Burping Brook, the first crossing of which  received a bridge thanks to WTA work crews in August 2014.Finally, arrive at Smith Gap, where you'll find the new snowshoe warming hut, built by the Friends of Mount Spokane State Park with the help of community grants and donations.  The table inside was hand-built by a WTA blue-hat from white pine salvaged from the Nordic ski trails. Pause here to enjoy a picnic lunch, then take the Mount Kit Carson Loop Road downhill to complete the loop and return to the parking lot. Picnickers will pass several other tables along this route should Smith Gap be too busy.","driving_directions":"From Spokane, take Hwy 2 north 10 miles.

In a quarter mile it joins the south-bound Wonderland Trail that arrives here from Sunrise. So, in addition to encountering other day hikers, you might meet a few Wonderland Trail backpackers who are out for one or several nights.Not much sun reaches the forest floor along the first part of your trail, but a few shade-tolerant wildflowers do manage to thrive here. Look particularly for sidebells pyrola, queen's cup and coral root.The way crosses an occasional small stream and gradually becomes steeper. You will come to a rocky switchback where Fryingpan Creek rushes down a narrow cleft in the rock some fifty feet below the trail. You can take a careful look, but it's difficult to get a good photo there. Farther along, at another switchback, there is a good view down on a section of rapids along the creek.The trail continues on, still in the forest. Occasional openings on your left offer brief glimpses up to the cliffy north face of the Cowlitz Chimneys, where snow banks often remain until late summer, feeding meltwater to small cascades that drop precipitously down to become part of Fryingpan Creek.As you continue on, the forest around you changes gradually, the trees become smaller and the species different. Soon you are out on more open slopes, with small alpine firs and a lot of white rhododendron shrubs (distantly related to the rhodies you see in town) that often display their small white blooms in June. Your trail approaches Fryingpan Creek again, and soon you'll come to a crossing on a sturdy log with a flattened top. There's a railing too, although it often seems to lean over a bit too far toward the downstream side. Pause on the bridge, if you are comfortable. Get a good look at the milky, gritty glacial water, and take in the view upstream where part of the mountain is visible.Beyond the crossing, the trail parallels the creek for a while, in a section edged with shrubs and with a mix of wildflowers, particularly valerian. It can get warm here on a summer afternoon. Soon the route begins to switchback up the slope to the left. There is some shade there, so it may be cooler. The wildflowers on this north-facing slope peak later than those up in the meadow, so you may see a few species here long after those in the meadow are gone for the season. Soon, the switchbacks end and you take the final steps into the wildflower meadows at Summerland. When the snow first melts, avalanche lilies appear here, to be followed later by lupine, Indian paintbrush, white pedicularis and many others. On a warm afternoon the perfume can be very intense.Summerland offers designated camp sites and a group shelter, along the east side of the meadow. Camp sites here, as everywhere in the park, must be reserved in advance.Look beyond the flower meadows and take in the views up to Little Tahoma, and to the summit dome of Mount Rainier. Summerland is a great place just to sit and relax for a while. Then continue on the trail just a short way, surrounded by meadows and occasional small streams. You likely will see marmots here, and black bear sightings are not unusual. While you explore, please stay on the trails to help preserve the very fragile alpine vegetation.Summerland is itself a worthy hiking destination. You have come up 2,000 feet in about 4.5 miles, and it's fine to make it your goal for the day. But the trail does go on. Panhandle Gap beckons, another 1.5 miles along and 900 feet higher. If your time and energy permit, you really shouldn't miss it.Once you step out of the grassy meadows and start up onto the rocky moraine it's a passage into a different world. A world of boulders and gravel, of rushing melt water streams, and shallow tarns that may be ice-covered, or may sport snow bergs, well into the summer. There are wildflowers up here too, but they are hardy varieties that can survive rooted in narrow clefts that are buried in snow for much of the year.Goats find forage on the steep slopes, at least in summer, and your odds of seeing them near the gap are good. Sometimes, on hot afternoons, they bed down on remaining snow banks to keep cool. For the bears, Panhandle Gap offers little in the way of forage. But bears, like hikers, do travel this stony route, on their way to the other side of the mountain.The ongoing trail sometimes is edged with small stones or may be marked with cairns, some of them painted a deep orange. Until late summer, parts of the route may remain snow covered, but the footing generally is good most of the way. On the final approach to the gap there is a short section of trail that crosses a steep slope with boulders at the bottom. When snow lingers there late in the season the traverse may require some care. Look it over carefully before proceeding, particularly if it is frozen hard. Trekking poles may be advisable here. Check recent trip reports for advice on current conditions.When you finally do step out onto the top of the gap, the view toward to south is amazing. Clouds permitting, the Goat Rocks and Mount Adams dominate the southern horizon, with the summit of Oregon's Mount Hood often visible in the distance. The Wonderland Trail continues on south from the gap, crossing Ohanapecosh Park on its way to Indian Bar, and beyond.For day hikers, the gap is your turn-around point. But don't hurry. Sit a while, enjoy a bit of lunch and a sip of water, and just enjoy the views. If you haven't seen goats so far, they may well appear for you while you are at the gap. But eventually you have to descend, carefully if that steep snow traverse is still there, and find your way back to Summerland, and then on to your trailhead.","driving_directions":"Follow Highway 410 about 36 miles south of Enumclaw and pass under the arch that marks the boundary of Mount Rainier National Park.

The trailhead parking area comes up quickly, just beyond the bridge over Fryingpan Creek. There is room for about 25 cars to park on the right in painted slots, and room for a few more along the shoulder on the left where the beginning of the trail to Summerland will be obvious.","distance":"12.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"46.8883666667","longitude":"-121.611033333","elevation_gain":"2950","highest_point":"6800"},{"features":["Wildflowers/Meadows","Mountain views","Wildlife","Old growth","Good for kids","Lakes"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/mount_rainier_area.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//46.8905,-121.5968/@46.8905,-121.5968,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/owyhigh-lakes.jpg/@@images/0f63534b-daa4-4ebd-8eb2-f383e2415c5e.jpeg","region":"Mount Rainier Area","current_rating":"3.00 out of 5","name":"Owyhigh Lakes","trail_description":"The local wildlife love the Owyhigh Lakes. This pair of shallow forest lakes provides good water, lots of forage in the shoreline meadows, and wonderful cover in the forests that press in around the lakes. Hikers find limited views from the trail—though there are nice views up to Cowlitz Chimneys and Tamanos Mountain. But the forest environment this trail -explores is unmatched for those who appreciate a rich woodland ecosystem. Kids and adults appreciate the wildlife-viewing potential. Birds and beasts (large and small) thrive in this forest, and birds fill the lakes basin. Repeated visits to the lakes have let me spot grouse, pileated woodpeckers, mountain blue jays, cedar waxwings, ospreys, bald eagles, golden eagles, tanagers, and a host of birds I couldn’t identify. There’s also a fair amount of huckle-berries along the route if you time your trip just right.Running south through lush old forest, the trail climbs steadily from the get-go. The initial climb starts with a 0.25-mile-long ascending traverse before swinging into a series of switchbacks. The rush upward continues over the first 2.5 miles as the trail runs up the northern spine of Tamanos Mountain. Listen for birdsong along this stretch, and keep your eyes open for small critters in the forests along the trail.At 2.5 miles, the trail sweeps out into a hillside traverse, reaching Tamanos Creek Camp at 3 miles. The small namesake creek is a seasonal feeder of Shaw Creek, which drains -Owyhigh Lakes. Tamanos Creek usually dries up by early September, so don’t plan on camping here late in the season. From the camp, the trail drops to a nearly flat pitch for the final 0.5 mile to the lakes basin. The shallow lakes are wonderful for cooling your feet—but not great for swimming. As you approach the lakes, stay quiet and keep a keen eye out for a moment in the forests and meadows around the lakes. You might see deer, elk, or even mountain goats—the goats descend from the craggy heights above to drink here. Enjoy the views of the Cowlitz Chimneys above the lakes, and maybe doze in the sun-dappled meadows, before pushing on the final 0.5 mile to the 5400-foot pass separating Governors Ridge from Tamanos Mountain. The pass provides good views of each peak, as well as the high spires of the Chimneys to the west. Turn back here. Note: This trail was severely damaged in the November 2006 floods. As this book went to press, this trail was relocated through rough terrain. Check with the park for the current status of this trail.","driving_directions":"From Enumclaw, drive east 43 miles on State Route 410 to the Mount Rainier National Park White River Entrance.

The Sourdough Ridge Trail, which begins in the thick of the tourist-choked Sunrise visitor center, leaves it all fairly quickly, climbing to a ridge top and turning east beneath Antler Peak. Kids love the open views and general abundance of marmots.At the trailhead near the rest rooms on the north side of the parking lot, head north across meadows for 0.2 mile to reach a Y-junction. You’ll start and end here, so you could go either way, though I recommend going right to do the loop counterclockwise. Follow the slanting trail about 0.5 mile to the top of Sourdough Ridge. The hard-packed trail climbs 400 feet to the crest of Sourdough Ridge and a junction with the ridge-top trail. If you go right (east), you’ll wander 1.3 miles to Dege Peak (Hike 31). That’s a trip for another day, however. Instead, go left and skirt under the summit of Antler Peak. After about 0.2 mile, you’ll get around Antler and find yourself on the edge of a sharp ridge line. From the ridge, you can look south to Mount Rainier and beyond. Little Tahoma Peak stands to the east of the mountain, and the deep green valleys of the William O. Douglas Wilderness push away to the east. To the north is the stunningly pretty valley of Huckleberry Creek, and the long line of the Sourdough Mountains stretches away to the northeast.Continue west along this spine for another 0.3 mile, where you’ll meet another trail fork (1.25 miles from the start). To the left is the trail forming the other branch of that Y you encountered at the start of your trek. Keep that in mind, but for now, continue straight ahead to follow Sourdough Ridge farther west—the best views are still ahead. In just 0.25 mile, you come around a small knoll to return to the precipitous edge of the ridge above Huckleberry Basin. This time, though, you’ll be able to look down on a green parkland bench floating halfway down the valley wall. This green terrace frequently is graced by herds of mountain goats and, on occasion, elk. This is a wonderful place to stop and rest before turning back to that just-past junction, where you turn right to descend 0.8 mile back to the trailhead, closing your stretched-out loop hike.","driving_directions":"From Enumclaw, drive east 43 miles on State Route 410 to the Mount Rainier National Park White River Entrance.

Since then, hikers of all stripes have had the pleasure of enjoying a brand-new route to one of the mountain's most iconic glaciers on an easy-to-hike trail. Originally a mining road along the Inter Fork of the White River, the route was converted into a trail when the area became a national park. Visitors ranged from climbers accessing the popular Emmons Glacier, to families strolling out of White River campground. Located in close proximity to the dynamic, glacier-fed White River, the original trail was frequently damaged by the river's shifting course. After the floods in 2006, the park elected to build a new trail that was no longer subject to the floods. Thanks to a Herculean effort by WTA volunteers and Mount Rainier National Park (after all, 6,500 feet of trail isn't the easiest task to complete) the 3.25-mile hike up the Inter Fork of the White River is now a breeze. Along the way, you'll pass a half mile side trail heading up Emmons Moraine. This one is worth a detour, as it offers incredible views of Emmons Glacier, the largest sheet of ice on Rainier, and a milky blue-green glacial lake below. Another mile up, pass the junction with the Burroughs Mountain Trail and continue into the Glacier Basin wilderness camp in a forested glen, where six campsites are available, including a group site. Just beyond the camp, Glacier Basin opens up in all its glory, with wide meadows, a large shimmering tarn, and views up The Mountain of The Wedge and Mount Ruth. You'll also see a well-worn climber's trail continuing up to Camps Curtis and Schurman. WTA Pro Tip: Make this a loop trip! Note that this route is quite a bit longer -- clocking in at 11.5 miles and 3100 feet of elevation gain. On the way, you'll summit 7,400 foot Burroughs Mountain, descend to Frozen Lake, then head southeast on the Wonderland Trail through Sunrise Camp and Shadow Lake, then back down to where you started at White River Campground.","driving_directions":"From Enumclaw, head east on Highway 410 for 43 miles to the White River entrance to the park.

Many of them can be viewed close-up from day hikes around the mountain, but none encompasses the sheer mass of Emmons Glacier. Descending more than 2 vertical miles from the summit, Emmons Glacier has a surface area of 4.3 square miles and has gone through various stages of retreat and advance over the last century.Start your hike at the Glacier Basin Trailhead in the White River Campground on the road to Sunrise. Much of the lower section of this trail was washed away in the storms of 2006–2007. Over the following four years, WTA, the National Park Service and several partner organizations completely rebuilt the trail higher upslope to its original CCC standards, making for a comfortable hiking opportunity for all ages.The trail gently climbs through shady forest of hemlock and cedar, with occasional peeks of Rainier's summit and Little Tahoma. Pass a small, cascading waterfall as monkeyflower, cow-parsnip and shootingstar decorate the trailside. At 1 mile, a spur trail forks left to cross the Inter Fork on a railed footlog. Hold on to little ones while crossing the churning waters. Now on the Emmons Moraine, follow the trail upward for 0.5 mile to a viewpoint overlooking Emmons Glacier flowing down The Mountain.The lower portion of the glacier was covered by a rockfall from Little Tahoma in the 1960s, insulating it and slowing its retreat.

If you can get past its quiet shores, it's a short jaunt to connect with the Craggy Peak trail and miles of ridgeline hiking that the Dark Divide Roadless Area affords. From the trailhead at the end of Road 9331, descend into open forest. Tall trees tower over you--noble fir, grand fir, and Doug-fir lend their scent to the air. The rolling trail guides you through two large meadows. These green oases are bursting with lupine and avalanche lilies once the snow melts out, but note that snow sticks around late in the season here, and these areas can be boggy when wet. After passing through two meadows, the trail rises up only to make a final plunge down to Blue Lake. That's right--only a mile into your hike and you're already at your destination! Blue Lake is visible from the small hill you climb out of the meadow, but a trail winds around and plops you right on the edge of its gorgeous, blue-green waters. This is a great spot for families who want to fish, camp, or simply do a short dayhike. But the trail continues. If you feel like further exploration, push on past the lake. The trail continues to roll, but with more elevation gain and loss, before crossing a babbling creek at the mile and a half mark, and then popping out into a wide wildflower meadow. Bees buzz here (and other bugs--bring your spray). A small seasonal stream wends its way through the meadow, and at the north edge is a small camp, Basin Camp. The only trick here is the trail.

The south trail to the lake leads through a recovering forest of bigleaf maple, alder, Douglas fir, and western hemlock, meandering 4.5 miles to a riparian hideout, providing waterfalls, old growth, fall color, and year-round hiking to those who make the journey.Choices, choices: find your way to Lost Lake via one of four routes that vary widely in terrain, views, and elevation profile. One of those is the south Lost Lake trail, which in turn has two options for starting the hike. One starts close to and the other starts from the Lost Lake (formerly Clayton Beach) parking area near the entrance to Larrabee State Park. The slightly more scenic but longer route follows the Fragrance Lake trail. Hike the trail for 2.3 miles until it reaches the service road. Turn right on the service road and go 0.1 mile until you reach the Lost Lake hiking trailhead on your left. You can also walk directly from the parking area, following the service road. Pass a cascading waterfall at 0.8 miles, and 1.2 miles later turn right at the sign for the Lost Lake hiking trailhead.The Lost Lake hiking trail proper follows the route of an old logging road in a southeasterly direction for 1.25 miles, steadily gaining elevation with occasional switchbacks. WTA has recently (November 2014) worked on this section to prune brush and improve drainage in this high-rainfall area. Along this segment, ascend to a high point of 1650 feet with views of Samish Bay in the winter. You will then start to descend, coming to a sign at a junction, indicating that the route to Lost Lake is to the left. If you do take the fork to the right, you will reach a clear-cut vantage point in 0.1 mile where you can look down upon the entirety of Lost Lake.Proceeding left at the above sign, continue north 0.6 miles to a small waterfall, and then the junction with the Rock Trail, on your left. Continue straight ahead; the lake lies 0.6 miles beyond. As you pass red cedars and hemlocks, marvel at old growth, munch on salmonberries if they are out, and stare at the rock walls to your left. When you reach the lake, at 1200 feet of elevation, continue upward again briefly and reach the junction with the north Lost Lake trail. Turn right to double back and find a large rock that offers views of the lake, and explore the waterfall at the outlet. Enjoy your time beside the lake’s calm, evergreen-encircled waters.WTA Pro Tip: the many trails of Larrabee State Park need your help!

A dedicated group of enthusiastic WTA volunteers worked countless hours here, carving a connector trail out of the steep, rugged hillside from the top of Cleator Road to the South Lost Lake Trail. The Rock Trail provides hikers and trail runners a steep climb, gorgeous views, and a peek at the area's fascinating geology. From the large parking lot at the Cleator Road trailhead, hikers get sneak peeks of Puget Sound through the trunks and branches of tall trees that surround the crown of the hill. But the trail begins descending almost immediately.  Though the way is steep -- count the number of stairs you encounter -- the route provides plenty of opportunity to enjoy the beauty of Larrabee State Park. Within a half-mile  of the upper trailhead are 100-foot high  sandstone cliffs pocked by little holes and large caves. Enormous mossy boulders lie all around you. This area provides an excellent diversion or rest stop for young hikers .While unusual sandstone formations are common at Larrabee State Park, hikers typically find them near the beach. But the cliffs on the Rock Trail are interesting because they share characteristics with the seaside rocks, despite being far removed from the shoreline. After exploring the imposing rocks, keep heading down through moss and licorice ferns, crossing a creek via \"Bogaards Bridge\", named for the WTA crew leaders who helped make the trail a reality.  Be sure to look up and out as you hike; on clear days, Mount Baker and the Twin Sisters glide into view just past the bridge. Continuing down, hikers clamber down three steep sets of stairs and wind through three more switchbacks until the trail flattens out. A huge boulder to the right of the trail, about three-quarters of a mile in , hides an interesting cave for exploring. From here the junction with the South Lost Lake Trail is quite close. Press on, and note how high the trees soar above your head! At the beginning of your hike, you could see over the tops of some of the trees whose bases you're now walking by. The end of the Rock Trail is marked by a wooden gate with a sign that indicates 'Hiker Only.'  The steepness of the trail is prohibitive to stock and mountain bikers, but other trails in Larrabee State Park are multi-use . If you plan to continue your hike as a loop, keep in mind you may encounter other trail users, and be sure to exercise proper trail etiquette.","driving_directions":"From I-5 South:  Take exit 250, and turn right onto Fairhaven Parkway.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

Though they've scaled many an international peak, many of them practiced their chops on this fairly diminutive, but close-to-town leg-burner. There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath. For those who are interested and have a good map there are numerous alternative trails that return to I-90 and exit 20.

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930’s and then as a ski area until the 1970’s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -– a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier. Bring a GPS device or download compass bearings from the park website as a backup. Such contingencies show that the dividing line between day-hiking and alpine conditions is blurred here, yet another way this hike takes you into truly rarefied air, more than halfway up the tallest peak in Washington.","driving_directions":"From the west, drive Highway 706 (National Park Highway) to the Nisqually Entrance to Mount Rainier National Park.

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive I-90 to exit 32. Turn left onto 436th Ave SE. Follow 436th to its end at SE North Bend Way. Turn left.

The 25-foot falls are the final waterfall along Cherry Creek. The falls drop over a wide, rocky ledge into a large pool. This pool is inviting to hikers, but as always with waterfalls, be careful when splashing and playing in rocky areas. Cherry Creek flows well all year long, but by autumn the left-hand side of the falls usually dries up.To find the unmarked trail head entrance, look directly behind the road sign marking the junction of Kelly Road and Moutain View Road.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Note that this stretch of the trail is prime snake terrain, so be cautious. At about 0.3 mile the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a small loop. We went left. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.But as the trail climbs, the scenery just gets better. Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia. Elsewhere, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow aster-like beauties, and microsensis painted the terrain. And oh! the bitterroot—when the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink.The memorial site (which can be seen from all along the trail) offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley as well as the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 101 (Thorp) and after exiting, turn right.

The river’s edge is lined with rows of bare white alder trunks in the winter or bright green foliage in the summer, and the surrounding forest is made up of a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees, a range of fern species, and epiphytes blending from one type to the next.Park in a small gravel lot in front of an unmarked, closed gate, and begin your loop journey either by slipping past the gate onto the old gravel road or by turning to the right and following the trail towards the river. Heading toward the river, follow the trail past a row of ecology blocks as you exit the parking lot. Continue to the river’s edge just a minute’s walk down the trail and stop to admire the steep clay banks sloping down to the water below. Next, retrace your steps just a few feet back and turn right (left coming from the parking lot) to continue down the river’s edge on the trail. At about 0.1 miles down the trail, the path opens out beneath a set of power lines. Directly under the power lines, heading to the left there’s a little boot path that provides an opportunity to rejoin the gravel road, which runs parallel to the trail and the water, just about 200 feet over. To the right, another little boot path angles downward to a viewpoint from the river’s bank.The viewpoint allows visitors to peer upstream past the rows of alders lining the shore to admire a series of weirs acting as a fish ladder to help salmon. Ladders provide areas of calm water that the fish can rest in as they struggle against the current. As salmon travel upstream to spawn each year, fish ladders are one way humans can encourage and aid salmon that are reclaiming an old habitat. Although thousands of salmon once swam in the Goldsborough, it is now a recovering ecosystem. The river was dammed in 1885, and coho, chum, steelhead, cutthroat, and other salmon had been struggling to survive without the full range of their habitat, but in 2001 the dam was finally removed. With the river no longer blocked, 25 miles of river habitat were opened to the fish. And the fish are coming back. Numbers had dropped dramatically when the dam was put in, but since the dam was removed numbers of young coho produced in Goldsborough accounted for 60 percent of young coho in that area of the South Puget Sound in 2006. As more salmon return to the river, scientists are closely monitoring the recovery. Although only a small river, Goldsborough provides a hopeful model for salmon recovery stories.Back on trail, continue through the riparian forest, keeping close to the bank the whole way. At about 0.4 miles, stop to sit on a log in a small wooden shelter and gaze out across the rushing water. From here, veer left and come to a three-way junction, where you will turn left to go back to the parking lot along the gravel road, which stops just several meters from the shelter. Climb a set of stairs and follow a boot path no more than 0.1 miles to a viewpoint above the river, or turn right to continue into the preserve on a dirt trail. Following this path, walk another 0.4 miles until the trail crosses a set of railroad tracks. On the other side, the trail continues for another 0.1 miles until it rounds a bend in the river. At this point, the fish weirs end and the river widens and calms as it turns the corner. From there the trail becomes unmaintained and eventually tapers off, but a boot path continues to ramble through the brush a little way farther. Stop to admire the river and then turn back to return to the shelter. From the shelter, return the same way along the river or loop around on the gravel road through the forest.","driving_directions":"From 101 north from Olympia, take the Matlock exit.

Over the course of its 44 miles, it presents a virtual highlight reel of dry-side beauty, from sage-scented meadows to subalpine parkland.The Kettle Crest Trail is part of the 1200 mile Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail, which extends from Glacier National Park in the east, to Olympic National Park in the west.Located in the far northeast corner of the state, the Kettle Crest features a half-dozen of Eastern Washington’s highest peaks, some topping out at more than 7,000 feet. Nominally a ridge-running route, the Kettle Crest tallies up nearly 8,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain over its length. Yet there are no cloud-piercing spires here, just a mosaic of old-growth forests and open sagebrush meadows, from which shimmer distant vistas of the Cascade and Rocky Mountains.Owing to its diversity of habitats and lack of human development, the Kettle Range boasts some of the best remaining wildlife habitat in Eastern Washington. Hikers should keep their eyes peeled for cougar, moose, mule deer and black bear, all cruising the high country. But in summer, the dazzling array of wildflowers—buckwheat, lupine, aster, yarrow, paintbrush, hawkweed and others—will likely keep your attention focused on the foreground.From the southern trailhead, ascend through profuse wildflowers on White Mountain before beginning a view-packed stretch past Barnaby Buttes and Bald Mountain. The southwest slope of Snow Peak holds great camp spots near the shelter. Skirt Sherman Peak and Columbia Mountain, then traipse along a sagebrush lined ridge; camp sites are scattered along the way. The high point is 7,140-foot Copper Butte, where fragments of an old lookout remain. Descend through a ghost forest of snags and settle in for open grasslands and lupine-filled fir forest, all the way to the northern trailhead at Boulder Pass. This is one of the sections of the trail that creep under ghostly silver snags left standing from past wildfires, most notably the 1988 White Mountain Fire, which scorched more than 20,000 acres of the southern Kettles. In these sections, wildlife, wildflowers and wide-open views have taken the place of the trees, making this one of the scenic highlights of the region.Aside from a few wooded saddles, virtually the entire route offers up big views: to the south, the Colville Indian Reservation and northernmost reaches of the Columbia Plateau; to the west, the Okanogan Highlands and, beyond, the Cascades; to the north, the peaks of British Columbia; and to the east, Idaho’s Selkirks.To the Colville tribe, whose ancestral lands encompassed the Kettle Range, the mountains bear sacred significance. On White Mountain, near the southern terminus of the trail, hikers can inspect cairns built by young members of the tribe during vision quests. Subsequent generations of visitors have also fallen under the spell of the Kettles, and a dedicated group of local conservationists has spent the last 40 years pressing for a congressional designation of wilderness for the Kettle Crest.WTA Pro Tip: Tapped springs, never more than a half-dozen miles apart, can hydrate hikers who plan refills carefully. Keep in mind this is open rangeland, and cattle congregate around the springs, some of which have been maintained in less-than stellar fashion by grazing leaseholders. Filter all your water.","driving_directions":"FROM THE SOUTH: From the town of Colville, drive 22 miles west on Hwy 20 (the Sherman Pass Scenic Byway). Make a left and head southwest on the S.

Surrounded by sunbaked hills of golden grasses, this small forested tract retains moisture, making it a cool green haven on a hot summer’s day. Old-growth ponderosa pines and cottonwoods help shade the way. Some of them graced this grove when Lewis and Clark passed through on May 2, 1806, on their return from the Pacific.Behind the restrooms, with silhouettes of the intrepid duo Lewis and Clark pointing the way, find the trailhead for the Fur, Fins, and Feathers Nature Trail. Grab an interpretive brochure (or ask the ranger for one), and then set out west (right) on this delightful little loop. You’ll immediately notice how thick the vegetation is. Nettles grow head high—stay on the trail or be zapped. The trail circles the campground, often resonating with the sounds of happy families. During quieter times, birdsong fills the air.After crossing a service road and the campground loop road, begin circling back under an impressive canopy of cottonwoods. The trail brushes alongside the Touchet River, providing good views out to the open countryside beyond. It was this promising countryside that attracted early settlers to the region, particularly French Canadians who came with the early fur brigades. Touchet is derived from the French word toucheur, which means “cattle driver.”But long before the fur trappers and Lewis and Clark, this region bustled with the activity of First Peoples. They traversed the area via the Nimipooiskit Trail, which extended from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. Remnants of this trail still exist in the valley.Notice the heavy sediment along the riverbank, evidence of past flooding and the reason why this area is so lush with vegetation and hosts a healthy assortment of birds. Look up at overhanging limbs for osprey. Look in the grasses for scurrying quails. And look out in the open fields for magpies.

Kalispell Rock sports the remains of a Forest Service cabin in the shadow of massive mushrooms of granite overlooking the Priest River drainage. Deer and moose frequent this route, as do, possibly, elk and bear.Go past the gate, over the earthen berm that blocks motor vehicles, and head up Kalispell Rock Trail No. 370, a former logging road. At 0.5 mile, bear left at the junction with another old road and continue up. (Take care to note the road junctions heading up the ridge; they can be easy to miss on the way down.)At 1.5 miles, just after the road slips over to the north side of the ridge, turn left on a lesser road that climbs sharply to the spine of the ridge. This is the sweet section of the old road portion of the route. At 2.3 miles, the route drops to a grassy opening and a trail junction. Trail No. 103 continues ahead (south), but Trail No. 370 makes a turn to the right and up on singletrack. Ah, now the hike is getting good.But pay attention. After hiking and climbing 0.2 mile, the trail levels and descends slightly. Just before reaching a more open area (where the trail eventually fades away), look for the main trail doubling back sharply to the right. This easy final 0.3 mile to the old lookout cabin site is the sweetest part of the hike.The tallest granite slabs at the lookout site are dangerous to climb. But just below the cabin site to the east is a rock slab that makes a great lunch spot. The cabin was built in 1927 as a refuge for the lookout staffer, who would climb a ladder to the alidade (firefinder) shelter on top of Kalispell Rock.The shelter was removed and the cabin left to decay after 1935. On the fourth log up the north inside wall of the old cabin, for as long as it lasts, is the inscription “Pete van Gelder” followed by a string of dates, ’48–’81. Van Gelder was a legendary member of the Spokane Mountaineers. The dates indicate his visits, leading volunteer groups, often with lookout historian Ray Kresek, to maintain this trail and others.","driving_directions":"From State Route 20 north of Newport, turn east into Usk.

A 1926 forest fire destroyed about 75 percent of the grove, but 22 acres attest to its original majesty. The trees are 800 years old on average, and a few may be more than 2000 years old. The whitewater rush of Granite Falls adds to the ambiance. Incidentally, Stagger Inn was the name given to the camp at this site for workers fighting that 1926 fire, describing the condition of the exhausted crews.From the trailhead kiosk, start with a short side trip to the left. Follow your ears to the rush of water tumbling through the rocks below the 70-foot slide of Granite Falls.

Come in summer for the blossoms, fall for the colors, anytime for sweeping sublime views of the Okanogan Highlands.The trail begins next to a beautiful wooden sign depicting the route, compliments of the Ferry County chapter of the Back Country Horsemen. Rock hop across Lambert Creek and reach a junction in 0.3 mile. You’ll be returning left, so continue right on the Old Stage Trail. Constructed in 1892, just three years after statehood, this old wagon road was an early attempt by legislators to construct a northern east–west route across the state. It was short lived, replaced in 1898 by a route over Sherman Pass that proved more favorable for hauling freight.In the 1990s much of the surrounding forest burned. Lack of shade warrants postponing this hike on the hottest of summer days, but spring and fall are lovely and surprisingly colorful. New greenery continues to colonize the scorched slopes. Flowers are dazzling in spring, and autumn colors are brilliant thanks to the blueberry bushes, cascaras, and currants. Look for woodpeckers among the snags and spruce grouse feasting on the buds of new plants.The grade is gentle, with wide sweeping switchbacks. At 1.8 miles, bear left at a junction. The trail right connects to an old forest road. At 2.7 miles, come to a spring (elev. 4700 ft), which like most in the Kettles should be treated because of contamination by cattle.After passing a grove of large fire-spared larches, the trail rounds a ridge to grant viewing of Midnight Mountain and then advances through a thicket of lodgepole pine. At 4.5 miles, cross a small creek. At 5 miles, skirt a small wetland. Alpine breezes high on the slopes of Copper Butte often leave more than a few downed snags across the trail here for you to hone your hurdling skills.At 5.8 miles, intersect the Kettle Crest Trail (elev. 6000 ft) at a high pass just north of the blocky butte.

Centerpiece of the 3594-acre Columbia Hills Natural Area Preserve, a land of oak and pine woodlands, grasslands, and rare plants, Stacker Butte stacks up among the area’s finest hiking destinations.While this hike consists of walking a service road to a ridge sporting towers of various form and function, in no way does that diminish the journey. The road is rarely traveled and you’ll hardly notice the towers. You’ll be too busy looking out at nonstop horizon-spanning views. And if you come in April or May, you’ll be awestruck by one of the finest floral shows in the entire Pacific Northwest. Balsamroot, lupine, paintbrush, phlox, larkspur, desert larkspur, and others paint this Columbia Hills peak in a radiant array of color.Before beginning, remember that your four-legged friend is not permitted here, and keep your feet from wandering off the road. Travel is permitted only on the preserve’s roadways to help protect one of Washington’s last large remnants of Idaho fescue and houndstongue hawkweed grassland communities. The preserve also harbors these three rare plants: obscure buttercup, Douglas’ draba, and hot-rock penstemon.The road climbs steadily across wide-open slopes. Did you remember the sunscreen? Wind shell? Views grow increasingly better with each step. From March to May, the flowers are profuse. And while busy admiring and identifying flora, don’t forget the area’s fauna, among them scampering ground squirrels, melodious meadowlarks, and flittering butterflies.At 1.1 miles (elev. 2600 ft), a jeep track on the right diverts to Oak Spring, one of the many springs that dot the Columbia Hills. Feel free to wander this road. The main road continues left, cresting the ridge (elev. 2875 ft) and reaching a large tower at 1.75 miles. The summit is now in view. Continue climbing another 0.75 mile to reach Stacker Butte’s 3200-foot summit, occupied by an oddly arranged and intriguing aviation tower.Cast it a glance, and then let your eyes run wild across the horizons: South to The Dalles, endless wheat fields, and Mount Hood pointing to the heavens. West to the heart of the Gorge, with Mount Defiance shadowing surrounding peaks and ridges. East to massive wind towers sprouting across the landscape like giant voodoo needles jabbing Mother Earth.

It was here along Garrison Bay that the Royal Marines established a presence for twelve years during the Pig War, which ultimately decided on Haro Strait as the international boundary, leaving San Juan Island for the Americans. A restored blockhouse, barracks, hospital, and storehouse remain at the site.

Watch for whales, including orcas, and an offshore pelagic cormorant roost. Then head inland for an equally challenging rolling ridge romp to Mount Maguire, highest summit in the sprawling East Sooke Regional Park—from where you can survey the rugged country you just conquered with your hiking boots.The 6.2-mile (10-km) Coast Trail (which is actually closer to 7.2 miles/11.6 km) is one of the most beautiful and challenging trails in the Victoria area. If you can arrange a pickup, the entire trail makes for a great one-way journey. If not, it is far too taxing for most hikers as an out-and-back. This hike explores the western half of the trail, combining it with a climb over Mount Maguire for an excellent all-day loop and cardiac workout.Follow the old Pike Road Trail, passing the Anderson Cove Trail at 0.6 mile (1 km)—your return route. Continue straight, passing another junction. Reach a privy at an overlook of Iron Mine Bay and the start of the Coast Trail (elev. 75 ft/23 m) at 1 mile (1.6 km). Head left on the Coast Trail and kiss easy walking goodbye.Pass a shelter, an interpretive display on past mining activity, and a trail leading to Mount Maguire. Your route hugs the coast, clambering over rocks and ledges that will slow your gait and allow for scenery savoring. The cumulative elevation gain on this hike is significant and hand usage frequent. The trail is well defined but easy to lose in foggy weather, especially on the rocky sections. Watch for yellow blazes.Watch for eagles and kingfishers too, as you grunt up and over ledges, dropping to hidden coves and climbing to stunning headlands. Pass a small island just offshore and great views of the Olympic Mountains. At about 1.7 miles (2.7 km), after crossing a creek on a bridge, reach a junction with the Coppermine Trail, a road-trail offering a bailout from the Coast Trail if you need it. Otherwise, carry on forward, traversing impressive ledges over O’Brien Point and enjoying views back to Pike Point. Pass some big trees before coming to the eastern extension of the Coppermine Trail at 2.5 miles (4.2 km).Drop into a couple of ravines before beginning a steep climb up some ledges (elev. 230 ft/70 m). Note a deep coastal chasm as Cabin Point now comes into view. At 3.4 miles (5.5 km), reach another bailout option—the Parkheights Trail (elev. 90 ft/27 m). Continue on the Coast Trail, exercising caution as you traverse exposed ledges above the shore. Begin a steep and difficult climb over a 180-foot (55-m) rib. Then steeply drop 100 ft (30 m) and steeply climb 100 feet (30 m)—repeat. A steeper climb warranting the use of your hands greets you next as you begin working your way up a 225-ft (69-m) coastal headland. Survey the wild coast with its myriad of rocky fingers and deep inlets. It bears a remarkable resemblance to Maine’s Acadian coast.Now moving inland and descending, come to the Babbington Hill Trail (elev. 130 ft/40 m) at 4.3 miles (6.9 km). Head left to begin circling back, first climbing a rocky route and then an old road to reach a junction (elev. 410 ft/125 m) at 4.8 miles (7.7 km). Go left on the Interior Trail, climbing up a grassy bald before descending slightly into a cedar grove. Then crest a notch in a ridge (elev. 560 ft/171 m), following an old road. At 5.5 miles (8.9 km), turn left at a junction (elev. 450 ft/137 m). Soon afterward, turn right at another junction lest you return to the Coast Trail.Crest a 620-ft (189-m) knoll and then steeply descend to an alder flat (elev. 470 ft/143 m) before steadily ascending to a 700-foot (213-m) bald with limited views. Drop 150 feet (46 m), then climb 50 feet (15 m), drop 40 feet (12 m), climb 60 feet (18 m)—the terrain is a rough-and-tumble roller coaster. At 7.2 miles (11.6 km), reach the Anderson Cove Trail (elev. 550 ft/168 m). Right heads to East Sooke Road. Head left, cresting a 625-foot (191-m) ledgy knoll. Then drop to the Swamp Bypass Trail (elev. 550 ft/168 m) and shortly afterward reach the Coppermine Trail at 7.6 miles (12.2 km).Continue straight on the Anderson Cove Trail, reaching another junction (elev. 610 ft/186 m) at 7.8 miles (12.6 km). If you have any energy remaining, go right 0.3 mile (0.5 km), up the steep Mount Maguire Trail, skirting the 869-foot (268-m) pine-cloaked summit to a (much appreciated) bench at a viewpoint of the Olympics across the strait.Retrace your steps to the previous junction and follow the Anderson Cove Trail right, dropping 60 feet (18 m), then climbing 90 feet (27 m), and finally beginning a last descent. Follow the trail across grassy ledges and through thick understory before reaching an old road bed. After passing a lone giant fir and crossing Pike Creek, reach a junction at 9.5 miles (15.3 km). Go right, following the creek through big timber, reaching the Pike Road Trail (elev. 120 ft/37 m) at 9.6 miles (15.4 km).

This grand loop ties all of it together, making for an excellent all-day exploration.By far the most popular trails within this park are the short Visitor Center Trail and the arduous Mount Finlayson Trail (Hike 129). But Goldstream contains several other trails often ignored by visitors. Part of the problem is access. The park is bisected by busy Trans-Canada Highway 1, with barriers and unsafe crossings that limit approaches to trailheads and loop combinations. However, when Niagara Creek and the Goldstream River are running low, a grand loop can be made by safely crossing under the highway.Begin by following the wide, graveled Visitor Center Trail along lush river bottomlands graced with towering cottonwoods and cedars. At 0.2 mile (0.3 km), the short Lower Goldstream Trail veers to the Goldstream River, offering opportunities for observing resident otters. At 0.3 mile (0.5 km), cross Niagara Creek on a bridge. If the excellent kid-friendly Goldstream Nature House (www.naturehouse.ca) is open, consider heading straight 0.1 mile (0.15 km) for a visit.For the loop hike, head left to a large culvert below Trans-Canada Highway 1. If the culvert is dry (Niagara Creek often takes a subterranean route here), walk through it and come to a trailhead (no northbound highway access). Here find a short path leading 0.1 mile (0.15 km) into a dank ravine to the base of impressive 156-foot (47.5-m) Niagara Falls. It’s well worth the side trip.For the loop, locate a path along the road barrier and follow it north, soon coming to the Gold Mine Trail. Start steeply climbing, crossing Niagara Creek on a bridge above the falls, where there is no falls view—but it’s plenty audible. Fencing helps persuade the foolhardy not to risk getting a view.The trail climbs steeply out of a narrow chasm, reaching a junction at 0.8 mile (1.3 km). The path right climbs to an impressive rail trestle over Niagara Creek (active rail line—stay off). You want to continue left through open forest. Reach a ledge (elev. 420 ft/128 m) with a growing-in view of Finlayson Arm, and then descend to an 1863-dug gold mine at 1.5 miles (2.4 km).Traverse a steep slope (ignore a side trail left to a spring) before descending through attractive old growth, reaching a junction with the Arbutus Ridge Trail (elev. 90 ft/27 m) at 2.2 miles (3.5 km). Left leads a short distance to a trailhead and the unmaintained spur to little Hidden Spring Falls. Go right, ascending through a grove of big Douglas firs. Bear left at an unmarked junction and cross a creek. At 2.8 miles (4.5 km), come to a junction with the Arbutus Trail.The going is easier right, so head that direction, cresting a 420-foot (128-m) ridge before again reaching a junction with the Arbutus Trail at 3 miles (4.8 km). Go right again, reaching a campground spur at 3.2 miles (5.2 km). Bear left, skirting a wetland pool and entering a thick stand of arbutus (hence the ridge and trail name). At 3.5 miles (5.6 km), reunite once again with the Arbutus Trail (elev. 380 ft/116 m). Bear right, passing a historical survey cairn and steeply descending to a junction at 3.6 miles (5.8 km). Right leads to the campground. Go left, soon reaching the Prospectors Trail.Continue left, paralleling the Goldstream River and steeply descending through luxuriant old-growth forest. At 4 miles (6.4 km), reach a bridge that spans the beautiful waterway just before a trailhead (elev. 120 ft/37 m) on busy Trans-Canada Highway 1. The trail continues on the east side of the highway. If the river is low, walk next to it below a highway bridge—otherwise, you’ll need to cross the highway, which is extremely dangerous. Proceed rapidly and only if the highway is absolutely clear.Resume hiking on trail, following concrete steps up a steep slope. Reach a junction at 4.2 miles (6.8 km) with a trail coming from park headquarters. Bear left, reaching another junction at 4.4 miles (7.1 km). Take the view loop right, climbing steeply through oaks, arbutuses, and flower gardens to a small ledge (elev. 510 ft/155 m) with limited views of the valley and Mount McDonald.Then descend. returning to the Prospectors Trail at 4.6 miles (7.4 km).

Eventually the forest recovered, the lookout became obsolete, and the trail was abandoned.

Please stay off of the structure both for your safety and the preservation of this historical relic. Besides, the forest has grown up around it, obscuring the wide views it once granted.

Twenty years later, Erickson and a slew of her Forest Service compatriots did just that, designing and building over 20 miles of trail on the long northern ridge above the Sol Duc Valley. They named features along the way, adding a whimsical flair to this rugged ridge. And with the recent opening of the Divide Trail, they continue to expand the trail network.Do this loop clockwise, tackling the steep climb first. Trail No. 882 starts in a dark, damp glen housing Littleton Creek, your last sure water for 9 miles. The way starts off easy before reaching a series of switchbacks that climb 2000 feet in 2.5 miles. In early summer, twinflower lines the trail like rows of tiny street lights. As you climb, you’ll traverse acres of young forest interrupted by big charred stumps.After 3 long uphill miles, crest the ridge (elev. 3250 ft) at Jims Junction.

Embrace a glorious view of the emerald wall of Aurora Ridge and the massive snow and ice heap of Mount Olympus. The trail then descends, bottoming out at Thomas Gap (elev. 3025 ft) before steeply regaining lost ground.At 4.5 miles, come to a junction (elev. 3425 ft) in Jasmine Meadow. Here, the new Divide Trail drops 2.8 miles to the trailhead, following old logging roads, railroad grades, and new tread. It offers a shorter loop option or a more direct route to Mount Muller. For Muller, continue left through more beautiful meadows. Views of the Sol Duc Valley below grow more impressive. Marvel at all the blossoms: paintbrush, tiger lily, thistle, bleeding heart, vetch, starflower, hawkweed, daisy, bear grass, columbine, lupine, strawberry, bunchberry, queen’s cup, and more.At 5.5 miles, come to a side trail (elev. 3660 ft) leading left for 0.1 mile to the semiforested 3748-foot summit of Mount Muller. Bag it. Then proceed on the main trail to another side path (take it), this one leading right 0.1 mile to Panorama Point, a series of outcrops in a sea of meadows. If you think the view can’t possibly get better, wait until you see Lake Crescent sparkling below. Like sentinels, Pyramid Mountain and Mount Storm King guard the fjord-like lake. Mount Baker hovers in the distance.After soaking up the view, continue up and down along the ridge crest, dashing behind ledges, passing a balanced rock, and undulating between forest and meadow. From Cahills Overlook at 7 miles, drop rapidly to Mosely Gap, a 2800-foot low point on the ridge. After one last uphill struggle of about 50 feet, begin a long descent back to the valley.At 8.2 miles, check out Fouts Rock House, two giant boulders rubbing shoulders.

While Mount Jupiter is nowhere near being one of the Olympics’ highest summits, its position along the eastern slope and its isolation from other peaks gives it a bit of distinction.

Fallen blackened trees, eroded tread, and choking brush make for difficult hiking and possibly tough routefinding. But though this is the hardest trail in the national park, Lake Constance is a fairly popular destination for bivouacking alpinists and a substantial number of tenacious hikers.Head up the extremely narrow draw cut by Constance Creek, clambering over root, rock, and downed trees along the crashing, bashing creek. The straight-up route defies gravity. Pass numerous picturesque cascades—many are fine destinations in themselves if you find yourself questioning continuing. Giant boulders litter the forest floor, including a couple of mini Rocks of Gibraltar. After gaining 1600 feet in just over 0.75 mile, the trail grants a reprieve. The relief is brief, though; the trail soon resumes its mountainside attack with even more fury. Fortunately, a cool canopy of old growth welcomes you after the burn zone.As the valley closes in, the trail has no choice but to go directly up the creekbed. It’s a rocky, brushy affair and, depending on water flow, also wet. The worst of this gauntlet is next. The route leaves the creek, ascending straight up the wall of the narrow draw. It’s steep but not exposed. Using your hands and Spidey strength, scramble up the abrupt slope. Occasionally look back at the Brothers hovering in the distance. Finally, at the brink of exhaustion, after probably the hardest 2.2 miles of your hiking career, enter the hidden basin housing Lake Constance (elev. 4800 ft). Its beauty should take away what little breath you have left.Despite this rugged setting beneath the Olympics’ third-highest summit, the lake-shore is fragile. Please walk lightly and respect areas closed for restoration. Consider walking 0.3 mile on a trail along the eastern lakeshore to an open area of talus and boulders, for a good place to sit in the sun above the lake. Nurse those knees for the descent.","driving_directions":"From Quilcene, drive south on US Highway 101 for 11 miles to Brinnon, turning right at milepost 306 onto Dosewallips Road.

This valley is rugged, isolated, and receives more than 12 feet of rain a year, and Native peoples have lived here for centuries. But it wasn’t until the late 1800s that a few hardy Americans of European descent migrated to this region of big timber and abundant game. The Kestner and Higley families lived on these grounds for decades, and the attractive stream bisecting this homestead and the peak shadowing it bears their names.Walk through the grounds, inspecting the main home, barn, outbuildings, and various farming relics. Look for elk—frequent visitors, especially during the winter months. After admiring the homestead, continue on the trail and return to the darkness of the forest.

If any cars are parked here, chances are the occupants are on the popular adjacent Lake Angeles Trail (Hike 80). It’s a tough hike to Heather Park, but the views and solitude will be worth it. Start hiking through a uniform forest of second-growth Douglas-firs. The original forest burned over one hundred years ago thanks to homesteaders who didn’t heed Smokey’s sound advice. Through a thick understory, the trail steadily climbs, at times steeply. At 1.5 miles, come to Halfway Rock (elev. 2900 ft), a glacial erratic marking the not-quite-midway point to Heather Park.The trail then eases somewhat before launching into more switchbacks. Skirting along the northeast slope of First Top, you’ll get glimpses through a thinning forest of the amazing views that await you at the summit. Craggy Second Top hovers ahead. The trail soon breaks out into the open, snaking steeply around basalt ledges bursting with blossoming wildflowers.At 4.2 miles, the way levels out, entering a small basin (elev. 5300 ft) tucked between First and Second Tops. This is the beginning of Heather Park, a subalpine bowl of flowers, boulders, stunted evergreens, and yes, heather. Come upon a small creek and campsites before making a final climb to wind-blasted and sunbaked Heather Pass. Piper’s bluebell, cinquefoil, and Olympic onion add colorful touches to the drab shale and scree that litter the pass.The view is amazing. But it’s better from a nearby knob on First Top, 100 feet higher and reached by following a small way path just to the right. From this 5740-foot basaltic shoulder of Mount Angeles, gaze out in every direction for supreme viewing. Port Angeles and the Strait of Juan de Fuca lie to the north 1 vertical mile below. To the east, follow the strait to islands flanked by the snowcapped Cascades. To the west, follow the strait as it parts the peninsula from Vancouver Island and leads to the Pacific.

Despite being named after Griff Creek, the trail travels along a dry ridge high above the waterway. Pack plenty of water.Begin in a daisy-dotted meadow just behind the Elwha Ranger Station. Traverse a park compound, entering a cool and mature forest of firs and cedars. Griff Creek roars in the distance, but that sound soon becomes a memory. Despite being lightly traveled, the tread is good and the trail is regularly maintained.At 0.5 mile, cross a seasonal creekbed. The way now wastes no time rising from the moist valley floor to a dry south-facing slope. As you ascend via a series of tight, steep switchbacks, the forest canopy thins, revealing teaser views of what lies ahead. At 1.6 miles, emerge at the base of a dry ledge. Manzanita and madronas frame a view east to the prominent Elwha River Range pinnacle, Unicorn Peak.Next, hike one sweeping switchback that delivers you to the top of that ledge. A sign indicates “Rock viewpoint el. 1875 feet.” Drop your pack, take a break, and enjoy the view—especially of the former Lake Mills bed above Glines Canyon on the Elwha River directly below. Mount Carrie towers in the distance. Admire the imposing and inhospitable wall of Baldy and Happy Lake Ridge directly across the wide valley, guarding the Hughes Creek drainage.This is a good turnaround point if you’ve had enough steepness. Otherwise, keep climbing to another fine viewpoint (elev. 2400 ft) at around 2.3 miles.

Within minutes emerge on a dry hillside, several hundred feet above roaring Jefferson Creek. Born in the snowfields of Mount Ellinor and her rugged neighbors, the creek crashes through a steep, narrow canyon before draining into the Hamma Hamma River.In early summer you’ll admire wildflowers painting the landscape as you traverse the sun-kissed canyon wall. Rhododendrons add to the array of colors, and a few flaky-barked madronas add a nice touch as well. The way then enters old-growth forest, makes a few ups and downs, and climbs about 150 feet. It then slightly descends, reaching a junction (elev. 1100 ft) at 1.1 miles. You’ll be returning from the left, so head right, through a grove of monster cedars to Elk Lake. Depending on the season, the lake may be a wet grassy swale or a pretty reflecting pool.

The mostly level trail follows Jefferson Creek through more impressive old growth. At 1.9 miles, reach FR 2401 and an upper trailhead. You can retrace your steps, but I prefer making a loop by following the road left for 0.8 mile, picking up the trail again just after crossing Cedar Creek. But first, just before the creek, head right for 0.2 mile to pretty little Upper Elk Lake (elev. 1150 ft). Then retrace your steps, cross the road, and follow the trail as it drops back down to the lower lake.Pass big trees and some nice shoreline lounging spots.

After a few switchbacks, the trail turns north, traversing a slope and gradually gaining elevation. After passing through a marshy area of big cedars, arrive at Madeline Creek (elev. 2100 ft) cascading through a narrow ravine at 5.4 miles. Cross it via a sturdy bridge. Traverse another hillside and then work your way up the Donahue Creek ravine. The way, now considerably steeper, parallels the cascading creek. At 7.1 miles, the climb eases and you reach a junction with the trail that heads to Black and White Lakes and Smith Lake.Continue right and after 0.6 mile, reach the two Flapjack Lakes (elev. 3850 ft).

Numerous creeks cross the trail, and it’s a challenge to keep your boots dry.After gaining a couple of hundred feet, the trail rounds a bend and enters the deep canyon, soon after entering the Colonel Bob Wilderness. Continue climbing under an emerald canopy of stately hemlocks and firs as frothing Fletcher Creek crashes in the distance. Waves of sword ferns seem to roll down the vertical canyon walls.After about 1 mile, the way gets rougher, growing rockier and rootier. Finally, the trail approaches the creek. Enter a magical spot where big mossy boulders corral the feisty waters. Stare across to the sheer vertical wall at the far side of the canyon, where you can see the scars of avalanches and rockslides.With good tread now a memory, the trail dashes under fallen giants, darts over slick rocks, skirts damp ledges, and wiggles through boulders on a steep course.

Head left up the grassy road-trail, crossing numerous boggy patches that sport showy orchids and monkey flowers. At 2.3 miles, reach a junction (elev. 3480 ft). The trail right travels 0.6 mile to a trailhead (elev. 3300 ft) on FR Spur 120. It’s possible to start your hike from here, saving 1.7 miles of hiking and 800 feet of elevation gain. But you risk compromising your vehicle’s tires and paint job.The trail left takes off for Baldy. Unmarked but well defined, this is the Maynard Burn Trail, created decades ago by the Forest Service as a bulldozed fire-protection lane. It climbs straight up (no exaggeration) a dry steep rib, gaining 2700 feet in 2.1 miles.Grind your way up the insanely steep grade. At about 3 miles, enter the Buckhorn Wilderness. Straddling the national park boundary, continue more wicked climbing. Gain a reprieve when the trail leaves the Cat track (elev. 5200 ft), and on a saner grade skirt a high slope above the Mueller Creek drainage. Trees thin and views begin as you emerge in an alpine meadow adorned in wildflowers. Asters, lupine, penstemon, and phlox paint the landscape a purple mountain majesty.Traverse a high bowl, coming to a clump of lodgepole pines. Then follow fading tread into open meadows and reach a 6200-foot saddle at 4.4 miles. Head left on pretty decent tread, cresting a 6537-foot false summit, and then descend on light tread to a 6360-foot saddle. One more push up an open ridge brings you to Baldy’s 6797-foot summit at 5.2 miles.The view, like the hike, will take your breath away. Mount Constance and Warrior Peak dominate the southern horizon over the sweeping, emerald Dungeness Valley. Look northeast over hundreds of islands, American and Canadian. Look north to Sequim, Sequim Bay, Victoria, and Dungeness Spit. To the northwest, Blue Mountain, Elk Mountain, and Mount Angeles fill the viewfinder. Mount Olympus also joins in. And look straight down into Royal Basin. Rest up and prep your knees for the descent.","driving_directions":"From Hood Canal Bridge, drive State Route 104 to its end, veering north onto US Highway 101.

Much of the way is directly alongside the roaring river. And as in the past, the river continues to jump its banks, forcing trail rebuilding and reroutes.About 1 mile from the trailhead, cross the first of several side creeks—easy during the summer, but winter rains can make this and the other crossings difficult. At 1.5 miles, traverse a huge gravel outwash area arranged with boughs of sword ferns and columns of maples swathed in moss. Next, cross a channel bed that may or may not be flowing. Traverse an alluvial island, and then negotiate the channel once more. Next, travel over more outwash, through groves of towering old growth, and along newly exposed riverbanks.At 2.6 miles, arrive at Wolf Bar Camp (elev. 650 ft), a suitable destination for a shorter hike. Head out on the broad gravel bar for views of the surrounding steep-sided ridges, usually hidden in swirling clouds. Beyond Wolf Bar the trail climbs a terrace, pulling away from the river. On an up-and-down course through thick forest, but always within earshot of the North Fork, the trail winds up the deep valley.At 5 miles, come to Wild Rose Creek, requiring a ford that may be dangerous during high water. The Halfway House site (elev. 850 ft) lies just beyond. It’s now a backcountry campsite—nothing remains of the old lodge. But the area’s charm is still in full swing.

Head north, following an old roadbed 0.6 mile to the still-signed old trailhead. Then continue on bona fide trail, soon emerging on a narrow shelf—the river thunders but it’s nowhere in view. Carefully creep to the edge of the trail and peer straight down. Directly below you, the South Fork Skok careens through a tight chasm, its booming waters occasionally interrupted by the high-pitched call of a rapids-loving dipper.At 1.2 miles, cross Rule Creek on a big log bridge. Shortly afterward, come to your first crossing of the South Fork Skok (elev. 1400 ft). Gone is the big bridge that once spanned it, but a large fallen cedar can be used (with caution) to cross. The trail then climbs 300 feet above the tumultuous waterway, weaving through a procession of old-growth giants that’ll leave your neck sore from constantly cocking it upward. This area was left out of the 1984 Washington Wilderness Act due to pressure from timber interests, and the Wild Olympics campaign is hoping to correct this environmental injustice (see the “Untrammeled Olympics” sidebar on page 118).Cross numerous side streams (plan on wet feet in early season) before coming to camps and the second crossing (elev. 1600 ft) of the South Fork Skok at 2.6 miles. In late summer the ford is usually a mere rock hop. In early season and rainy periods it can be tough, requiring extreme caution. Once across, continue up the valley through mossy glens and tranquil flats alongside the riverbed, but not always along the river, as sections of it often flow underground late in the season.The trail eventually pulls away from the river and begins climbing. The tread gets rockier and brushier. At 4.4 miles, come to Startup Creek (elev. 2000 ft), which can be tricky to cross when it’s flowing well. The way then begins to climb in earnest, making a long, sweeping switchback before getting down to business. At 5.3 miles, reach the national park boundary (dogs prohibited beyond). Soon afterward, come to a camp at the first of a series of pretty meadows where tread is absent. Angle to the northwest and you shouldn’t have trouble finding your way. Look for elk.Once you’re back in the forest, good tread returns. The way crosses a small creek and then steeply climbs to a small open basin graced with wildflowers and sparkling tarns, the headwaters of the South Fork Skok. The way then reenters forest and steeply climbs once more to reach forested Sundown Pass (elev. 4125 ft) at 7.4 miles.Next, descend, traversing meadows that offer good views of Wynoochee Pass and the Graves Creek drainage. Mount Olympus hovers in the distance. At 7.8 miles, come to a junction (elev. 3775 ft). Left leads to Wynoochee Pass (Hike 20) and the East Fork Quinault River (Hike 121). Go right, through a pretty basin, reaching Lake Sundown (elev. 3810 ft) at 8.2 miles. Good swimming. Good resting. Good camping (park permit required). Good workout.

The trail left heads back to the parking area and other nature trails. The trail north leads 0.1 mile to Sunrise Point, a 5450-foot viewpoint on the ridge. It’s a nice spot, but it gets better on Sunrise Ridge. So head to the right on the Mount Angeles Trail, dropping 200 feet from the saddle and leaving the hubbub of Hurricane Ridge behind.Undulating between groves of subalpine fir and resplendent alpine meadows, the trail works its way over and around a handful of knolls. Gaze north, out across the Strait of Juan de Fuca to massive Vancouver Island and its scads of mountains. Scan the strait eastward to snowy Mount Baker rising above a myriad of islands and inlets. Turn your attention south to the Olympic interior, to an emerald sea punctuated by craggy summits adorned in ice and snow. Mount Olympus, the centerpiece of this magnificent wilderness setting, dominates the southwest horizon. Of course, it’s impossible to ignore the imposing peak in front of you—the one growing taller with each step—6454-foot Mount Angeles.At 1.2 miles, the way rounds a 5500-foot knoll, after which it steeply drops 350 feet. Then it’s easy walking again, coming to a junction (elev. 5200 ft) at the base of Mount Angeles at 2.6 miles.

But it was the US Navy that cut most of this landmass off from the public by establishing an ammunition storage depot here. Fortunately, a narrow strip along the south shore of the island is a glorious county park.From the grassy bluff picnic area, follow the Portage Trail east through a tunnel of vegetation along Portage Canal. In late spring enjoy the fragrance and blossoms of primrose and honeysuckle. The trail brushes up against some marshy openings, ideal for seeking out eagles and herons. It then climbs back up a bluff, ending at the park’s beach-access road after 0.5 mile.You can hike left on the road a short distance and then follow the Lagoon Trail for 0.4 mile on a bluff above a big lagoon that teems with birds. But better exploring lies to the right. So walk the road and drop off the bluff, reaching an inviting beach at 0.7 mile. If the tide is low, rock hop or wade the small creek draining the lagoon. Then walk east along a sandy spit, one of the finest stretches of beach in the region. At 1.2 miles, pass a parking area (and alternative start if you don’t want to cross the creek).Continue your beach walk around bluffs of glacial till, taking in sweeping views across Oak Bay to Mount Rainier.

Why? Well, this route offers nearly everything you could want on an alpine ramble: vast wildflower fields, stunning panoramas that include towering glaciated peaks, high alpine meadows, cold alpine lakes, tons of birds and wildlife, and a good chance at solitude despite the incredible beauty of the route.Start up the Goat Ridge Trail (No. 95) as it climbs the snout of Goat Ridge. The first 1.5 miles ascend through old pine and fir forests. The airy woodlands present an open canopy with lots of sunshine reaching the forest floor. Taking advantage of that plentiful light is a mass of huckleberry bushes. The berries aren't as big and juicy as some found in more open meadows, but the fruit offers a tasty treat to hikers plodding up the steep trail. A small side trail branches off to the left at 1.5 miles-this is merely a scenic al-ternative that loops out around the steep west slope of Goat Ridge while the main trail hugs the meadow-dotted east side of the ridge. Just over 0.5 mile down the main trail, the secondary trail rejoins it (at 1.1 miles long, the alternative trail is more than a mile longer than the main route).Just after the first trail junction, the forest begins to open up, first with small forest glades scattered along the ridge, and finally the trees give way to broad, rolling meadows as the trail crosses under a large talus slope at 3 miles. Above this point, the trail climbs steeply into the flower-filled meadows. The views gradually improve as you ascend until, at 4.5 miles, the trail crosses over Goat Ridge in a deep saddle under Hawkeye Point. This ridge provides outstanding views west into the wildflower wonderland of Jordan Creek Basin to the west and Goat Creek basin to the east. From the ridge crossing, the trail traverses around the upper basin of Goat Creek to reach Goat Lake at 6 miles. There are a few campsites along the shores of the intensely cold lake. The lake is nestled in a north-facing rocky cirque and frequently has an ice shelf covering a portion of the water year-round.","driving_directions":"From Packwood, drive west on U.S. Highway 12 for 2 miles and turn left (south) onto Forest Road 21 (Johnson Creek Road).

Grasses sway in the breeze here, and after just a half mile of hiking, encounter a junction, where a trail leads uphill. This heads to the Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center, and is occasionally used by school groups on educational trips at Coldwater. Continue straight on, passing a structure about a mile and a quarter from the trailhead that houses a composting toilet -- a convenient surprise, and unusual for a hiking trail to have a toilet this far back. Take a break, if needed, and then continue on. The trail weaves in and out of the forest recovering from the St. Helens blast. Mostly sticking to water's edge, round a point half a mile shy of the head of the lake. This is a nice spot to stop and enjoy the scenery before continuing on. The trail continues past the head of the lake and further northeast along the tributaries that feed Coldwater Lake. Another 0.8 miles of hiking past the end of the lake brings you to a trail junction. This marks the point where the Lakes Trail splits.

There are some waterfalls along the way to distract you from the trail, but the ratio of scenery to effort is low on this early section of the trail -- you'll be sweating hard by the time you reach Rachel Lake.  When you arrive at the lake, look for a trail on your right marked “Trail”, near the trail to the privy (marked “Toilet”). This trail heads north initially, and then turns west as it travels around the north side of the lake. But before you set out, take a break for a few minutes to enjoy Rachel Lake. The lake is a worthy destination in its own right, with plenty of space to spread out and camp, swim, or just relax.  When you’re ready to continue climbing, head back to the trail signed “Trail”. This rocky trail switchbacks steeply up to the ridge in just half a mile. Along the way, you will enjoy periodic views of Rachel Lake.When you get to the ridge, you will see a trail off to your right. This is the trail to Lila Lake. The sign for the junction is a few yards further up the trail. The trail to the left heads to Rampart Lakes, a pretty collection of pothole lakes and a maze of social trails between them. You want the trail to the right, to Lila Lake.The trail gets a little brushy at times, so be sure to reference your map if you're unsure which way to go. Enjoy a few more views of Rachel Lake, and after 0.3 miles, arrive at a junction marked by a cairn. The trail to the left is a climber’s path up Alta Mountain. Steep, rough, and non-technical, it should not be attempted by those with a fear of heights. Continue straight ahead for Lila Lake. Pass through a short area of talus on a good trail, and then arrive at a small tarn. Skirt around the right side of the tarn, and look for a trail to your right. It may not be obvious. If you arrive at a rocky overlook of Lila Lake and its long, narrow island, you have passed that trail. Turn around, and find the trail down to the lake. The trail down to the lake is steep and a little muddy. Bring hiking poles for the descent.At the lake, you will find several campsites, each offering a reasonable amount of privacy and distance from your neighbors. There are also some nice rocks to sit on, and towards the end of summer there are more berries than you can possibly eat.  WTA Pro Tip: If you’re backpacking, consider side trips to Alta Mountain and Rampart Lakes.","driving_directions":"From I-90 heading east, take exit 62. Take a left and cross over the highway.

During every visit in late summer, I slow my hiking so I can pick as many ripe berries as possible while still making some trail mileage. Of course, berries aren't always ripe, so it's a good thing this trail offers far more than ripe fruit. It provides stunning views of the peaks of the South Cascades, including the near-perfect cone of Mount Adams, and ample opportunity to witness wildlife.The trail begins near the eastern end of the campground. The Nannie Ridge Trail (No. 98) climbs north through dense pine forests for more than a mile, crossing a couple of shallow creeks (often dry late in the year) and gradually gaining elevation. One problem you might encounter is that the area's abundant volcanoes have dumped a lot of light ash into the dirt, leaving it gritty and powdery. In fact, by midsummer, the dirt trail is churned into several inches of billowy dust. As the trail nears the 1.5-mile point, the forests begin to open with spacious clearings scattered throughout. Here's where the fun begins. Hit the trail in late August, and you'll find these clearings a deep shade of purple, provided you get there before the other hikers and the bears. At 3 miles, the trail tops the ridge crest just below the summit of Nannie Peak. A short, 0.5-mile way trail leads to the summit of the peak, and it is well worth the effort to scramble up this boot-beaten path to enjoy the outstanding views, and wonderful mountaintop meadows. The views are dominated by the  big three southern volcanoes-Mount Rainier to the north, Mount Adams to the south, and Mount St. Helens to the southwest-but the jagged crests of the Goat Rocks peaks to the northeast are also not to be missed.The trail continues east from Nannie Peak, along but just below the crest of Nannie Ridge, dropping several hundred feet below the ridge for a while in order to avoid some towering cliffs. At 4.4 miles, you'll find Sheep Lake at the junction with the Pacific Crest Trail. The best campsite is on the knoll to the south of the lake where you'll enjoy evening views of alpenglow on Mount Adams. The lake is large enough to be clear and cool, but shallow enough that the summer sun takes the bone-chilling cold out of the snowmelt water. That makes it a fine place to turn around and return home.","driving_directions":"From Packwood, drive west on U.S. Highway 12 for 2 miles and turn left (south) onto Forest Road 21 (Johnson Creek Road).

Hikers, equestrians, and mountain bikers can all enjoy the nearly 13 miles of trails here. There are a variety of access points, but the parking area just outside of Klahowya Secondary School offers access to the small northwest quadrant, as well as the larger southeast section. If you’re strapped for time, head across the road from the parking area, keeping the gate on the road to the school on your right. Stop at the trailhead sign for a map – they’re very helpful – and get on your way! At the first junction, stay straight ahead and jump onto the Big Cedar trail. This leads through wide open forest, full of (you guessed it) big cedar trees. But there are also hemlock here, and rhododendrons, as well as swordfern and a staggering variety of mosses carpeting the forest floor. At the next junction, bear left onto the Alder Pass Trail, a gentle up-and-down trail that goes over a low pass with big alder trees. Another left at the next intersection joins up with the Beaver Loop Trail. Look for the wetland through tree branches to your right as you hike the winding trail as it heads downhill to yet another junction. Here, make a left onto Bobcat Run. Stay on this lower-elevation trail for the next half mile. Enjoy nurse stumps sprouting new growth and more mossy branches, which make the trail seem much more remote than just off the Seabeck Highway. Pass the junction with the Deer Loop – if you’ve got time, take a trip that way – it adds 0.8 miles to the hike’s total. The last intersection is where you started, where you finally get to turn right, and out, back to your car. If you have a little more time to explore, look behind your car for the Deer Fern Trail, which leads to further adventures in the southeast section of the park. The Deer Fern Trail leads to the Old Road Loop, and there is the option to take the Wildlife Trail through the wetlands to observe any wildlife that may be lingering. There are maps at the trailheads to help plan your route, and they help if you find that you would like to extend your hike.Several mountain bike loop routes branch off the south end of the loop trail, or you can explore Rhodie Hill, Salal Ridge and Whisper Ridge near the northeast edge of the loop. These are all pretty steep climbs, but short enough that you won't get too exhausted.

And because it is an active volcano, it is best not to put it off for too long. Climbing to the crater rim is an opportunity to see not only amazing views in every direction, but to see geology raw, unformed and in its making.The hike is hard, but requires no technical climbing skills. The trailhead is known as the Climbers’ Bivouac. The first 2.1 miles climbs 1000 feet through forests and open meadows to the Loowit Trail, which circuits the mountain. This section of trail is described in detail in WTA’s Hiking Guide as Ptarmigan Trail. Continuing much past the Loowit Trail requires a climber’s permit (details below). This is where the trail ascends to Monitor Ridge, and the way gets more difficult from here. The next 2500 vertical feet is through boulder fields – and not any ordinary boulder fields. These rocks are dusted with an ash pumice than tends to shred the skin. You’d be wise to bring garden gloves for this section! It can also be windy, so bring layers and a jacket as well.The last section of trail climbs about 1000 vertical feet through ash and small rocks to the crater rim. It’s described by many as “two steps forward and one step back.” Gaiters and long pants are a good choice here. And to get your mind off of the slow slog, be sure to take in the views! You are going upward and before you know it you will be standing on the summit.The scene at the top is almost surreal – the huge crater with a dome growing rapidly in size each year and the state’s newest glacier forming a horseshoe around it. And the incredible views to Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Rainier floating above the blue-green undulating hills surrounding them. Be sure to stay well-back from the rim while taking photos; this is a cornice and could easily break under your feet.After enjoying the top, it is time to head down. Trekking poles are a big help for the knees. Depending upon the time of year, it is also possible to glissade down part of the mountain (but be cautious).The fine print about climbing Mount St. Helens: Permits for climbing above 4800 feet are required year-round and are available for purchase online through the Mount St. Helens Institute's website at http://mshinstitute.org/index.php/climbing/index. If you're climbing between April 1 and October 31, a limited number of people are allowed to climb the mountain on any given day. Permits can run out, so be sure to purchase yours well in advance of your trip. Snagging a permit for peak summer travel is best done in spring, but some permits are available on a first-come, first-serve basis at the Lone Fir Resort in Cougar. Most permits for weekends during spring and summer hiking season are sold out during the first week they are made available for purchase.Winter climbers can self-issue their permits at the Climber's Bivouac trailhead.

But for peak-baggers, or those simply interested in getting a gorgeous view from a relatively easy-to-navigate peak, the views are worth the extra effort. After climbing to Navaho Pass, it’s almost intuitive to begin wandering up the climber’s trail to Navaho Peak. The pass itself is beautiful, with views of the Stuart Range and Earl Peak filling your view. But it’s small, with not much room to spread out, and many a hiking group looking for a better lunch spot has found themselves climbing toward Navaho Peak. Head east out of the pass, paralleling the Stuart Range as you go. The trail is more or less straight up; a true climber’s trail. The loose scree and soil is anchored somewhat in place by various wildflowers, including Indian Paintbrush and pentstemon, as well as phlox. These provide a welcome distraction from the continuous uphill plodding, as do the ever-improving views of the Teanaway, Central Washington sprawling beneath you, and the gray, snow-dotted peaks to the north. It’s a mile of climbing to reach the small summit of Navaho Peak, barely higher than a small rocky outcropping just to the east. Snow lingers up here into July, which can make the final push to the summit a bit of a route-finding endeavor, but once you’ve attained the summit, put on your windbreaker and enjoy the views. Play a peak identification game: how many of the surrounding summits can you name? Rainier and Adams make appearances on clear days, but even Mount Stuart can be hard to identify from this angle. Below you, the County Line Trail stretches away, down the Ingalls Creek valley into Chelan county, inviting even more exploration in the form of multi-day adventures. WTA Pro Tip: The summit of Navaho Peak only has room for about four or five people to sit comfortably, so if it’s a weekend, share the summit with other hikers who have made the same trek as you.","driving_directions":"","distance":"12.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.3661968","longitude":"-120.8028207","elevation_gain":"4223","highest_point":"7223"},{"features":[],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/north_cascades.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//48.8496,-121.6863/@48.8496,-121.6863,11z/data=?hl=en","region":"North Cascades","current_rating":"5.00 out of 5","name":"Mount Shuksan","trail_description":"A climb of Mount Shuksan via the Sulphide Glacier.","driving_directions":"","distance":"","latitude":"48.849580446","longitude":"-121.686286926","elevation_gain":"9127","highest_point":""},{"features":["Mountain views","Old growth","Summits"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/central_cascades.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//47.7884,-121.4482/@47.7884,-121.4482,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/south-summit-mount-baring-jem.jpg/@@images/97909a91-e365-42f2-9445-413d7040dc88.jpeg","region":"Central Cascades","current_rating":"4.33 out of 5","name":"Mount Baring","trail_description":"The unofficial Mount Baring trail shares the parking lot with the Barclay lake trail.

In springtime this rare island prairie environment is awash in beautiful blossoms. Maritime views grow with each step. At 0.3 mile (0.5 km), the Nature Trail loop heads left, offering your first alternative route.Continue forward through a clump of trees and then begin climbing more steeply, cresting the long ridge of Mount Finlayson. Roderick Finlayson of the Hudson’s Bay Company was a founder of Victoria, British Columbia, and its onetime mayor. You can see his higher and rockier namesake Canadian peak from this trail.Carry on along the windswept ridge, mouth agape at the astonishing views, from the snowcapped Olympic Mountains to the bluffs of Whidbey Island.

The original forest here was logged a century ago and now the trees are in a state of early maturation.At a quarter mile the trail jogs across an old logging road and soon enters old growth. The forest opens up with sword fern and shrubs among the stately trunks of ancient firs, which give way to hemlock as the trail climbs ever upward. It is cool and moist on the north aspect of the slope, enabling skunk cabbage and trillium to bloom into early summer. The forest to Mink Lake is beautiful, packed full of Queen's Cup, lilies and bunchberry flowers in bloom. At two miles, the trail rounds a spur at about 2800 feet, before gently arching toward the lake.At 2.5 miles and 3100 feet lies tiny Mink Lake. Hemlock, silver fir, and marshy beargrass meadows line the tranquil waters, which are often disturbed by jumping fish. Depending on the season, you may see Western Coralroot orchids and Indian Pipe, or beargrass, anenomes and violets around the lake.A side trail forks left where overnight hikers will find the bear wire and an old shelter, now home to rodents.The lake, while picturesque, is a haven for mosquitoes--bring plenty of bug spray or patience, whichever you prefer.

The trail starts just inside the entrance of the Wilcox campground, near the first vault toilet. The Mount Lillian Trail (1601) is good enough up to the first viewpoint, but shortly after, it degrades, becoming much dustier and slippery. This is thanks to the Table Mountain fire, which burned through here in 2012. While a significant amount of the forest survived and small flora is returning, you'll be hiking in and out of the big burn area. To avoid scrambling up (or down) the unstable tread in the burn, detour off Trail 1601 onto the jeep track 4W312, a junction you arrive at 0.6 miles into your hike from the campground. This jeep track, while wider and less rugged, leads north to an open, rocky viewpoint, including the Teanaway, the peaks of the Enchantments and even Glacier Peak. This viewpoint is found at the northwest corner of a high plateau, along a rim road with the best wildflower fields in the area.From there, the jeep track heads east a few hundred yards to the southern terminus of the Tronsen Ridge Trail. At this junction, the road curves around to the south, and after 0.6 miles, arrive at a fork in the trail. The righthand trail rejoins is 1601, which you can take down to the trailhead. WTA Pro Tip: The trail leading left takes you to the summit of Mount Lillian in 1.5 miles. This route can be very slippery and difficult to navigate thanks to the aforementioned fire -- if you decide to continue up to the actual top of the large face (hiking southeast from the junction with the Tronsen Ridge trail), bring trekking poles and gaiters, to help with stabilization and keeping dust out of your shoes.","driving_directions":"Drive to the summit of Blewett Pass on Highway 97.

Its sheer wall of a summit is very striking and easily instills visions of alpinism in those headed to Mount Forgotten Meadows, but the route takes a roundabout journey that requires not so much vertiginous daring-do as it does oodles of patience. The views from the top are spectacular, particularly the unobstructed view straight up Glacier Peak.Start out at the Perry Creek Trailhead and follow the Perry Creek Trail to its end (full description here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/perry-creek). At the Mount Forgotten Meadows, head left to a spot where the high point above the tarns tapers down to the ridge. The biggest obstacle on the way to the top is here at the start, as the route drops over the edge. A short scramble without a lot of distinct holds (and very slippery when wet) ensues and descends to dirt and rock that is steep, but not quite steep enough to allow use of hands. After a hardscrabble loss of 200 feet in elevation, a rough, but distinct, trail emerges and traverses the southeast side of the mountain more or less in a straight, steadily ascending line. The next six tenths of a mile will feel mostly like a hike. Only in spots does the trail get truly informal and seem to dead end against the bark of a random tree. If you lose your way, stay on your most recent line, and chances are the trail will pick up again pretty much exactly where you would expect it to. After a long traverse and the occasional switchback, the trail reaches a broad shoulder on the east side of the peak looking out over the Sauk River drainage. The route now makes a hairpin turn, proceeding due west up a loose gully. After a short, steep climb over scree, the trail reaches solid ground again. From here, a surprisingly well groomed path proceeds through open slopes of heather. And then the trail abruptly ends in a few relatively short boulders that mark the summit. From this direction, Mount Forgotten is tame as a kitten. What happened to that airy summit? It hasn’t gone anywhere – the boulders of the summit mark the boundary between idyllic meadow and the sheer dropoff you may have gazed at longingly before deciding to march up here. A word to the wise if you pose for heroic mountaintop photos – remember where you are and watch your step! From this vantage, all the usual suspects (White Chuck, Pugh, Baker et al) dot the horizon, but Glacier Peak is the real star - there is nothing but open space between you and its volcanic slopes. WTA Pro Tip: While the route is mostly tame and well established, the trail beyond the meadows and tarns is unmaintained. Some routefinding may be required, as other climbers (and animals) have created spur trails and shortcuts in spots.","driving_directions":"Take the Mountain Loop Highway east out of Granite Falls.

Climb steadily uphill and, in a half-mile, come to Mason Creek. Pause here to take in the view of 5162-foot McClellan Butte to the south. It will be visible for much of your hike, but it is most dramatic from this lower vantage. Once you reach the summit of 5584-foot Mount Defiance you will be over 400 feet higher than McClellan. Mason Creek, in late spring or summer, is easily crossed on boulders or small logs. But in early spring, with snow melting rapidly above, the creek can become a torrent, but luckily, thanks to the efforts of volunteer crews and the generosity of the Spring Trust for Trails, a sturdy footbridge has been installed across the creek, and hikers can safely cross it in all seasons.Continue on the logging grade a while, then leave the grade for a steeper climb with a few switchbacks. Look for the summit dome of Mount Rainier to appear over the southern horizon and, in more open areas along the trail, be alert for Indian paintbrush and lupine. When the trail passes through a short, dark forest section you may see a few stalks of coralroot in bloom.The trail emerges onto boulder fields, but with comfortable footing. In late spring or early summer you will be surrounded by a forest of beargrass interspersed with other flowers. Mount Defiance will be visible up ahead. Hike past the side trail to Bandera Mountain and press on toward Mason Lake. At the ridge top a memorial plaque honors Ira Spring, the well-known advocate for trails. Look for it just before descending some 200 feet toward Mason Lake. There is more shade on the north side of the ridge and, early in the season, the trail may still be moist or even muddy in spots. At the outlet of the lake cross Mason Creek once again, this time on secure boulders, and continue on. Soon, a sign for \"Main Trail\" points up some stepping stones while a lower trail leads to possible camp sites or fishing access.Farther along, the trail forks. A small sign will direct you to the right fork for the Main Trail. (The left branch would lead you into a swampy area and, eventually, to Little Mason Lake.) The right branch is your route for Mount Defiance, and in spring or early summer it too can have significant muddy spots. About 0.3 miles from the lake outlet come to a signed T-junction with the Mount Defiance Trail (#1009,) and turn left there.The route climbs steeply up the forested, shady east slope of Mount Defiance, with a few switchbacks. The way can be quite rooty and moist, and patches of snow can linger here well into July. Footprints in the snow, left by earlier hikers, will likely be visible, and the trail itself may reappear from time to time. Later in the summer the snow will be completely gone, the footing drier and the trail clear.The route winds around the south side of Mount Defiance where the snow disappears much earlier. After a few more switchbacks it emerges into a meadow. There, as the last of the snow is melting - perhaps in early June - a multitude of glacier lilies appears. But they are early bloomers, and to see them you may have to tolerate a few snow patches on Defiance's shady east side. As the season progresses other flowers will appear in the meadow.The trail traverses the meadow to its west end, where an unsigned but obvious route heads steeply upslope. It's rough, but easily followed and not dangerous. Trekking poles might be helpful. After a gain of less than 400 feet you will be on the stony summit of Mount Defiance.  Take in the views in every direction. Clouds permitting, a wide swath of summits will be visible from Mounts Adams and Rainier in the south to Mount Baker in the far north, with a host of Cascade peaks in between. Nearby, look for Granite and Bandera Mountains, and to the west look for Dirty Harry's Peak, Russian Butte, and Mount Teneriffe. The lake 1800 feet below is Lake Kulla Kulla. Often you will see sunlight glinting off ripples on its surface. Other, smaller lakes are visible too. Check your map and try to identify some of them, and perhaps identify additional peaks as well. Mount Defiance is an exceptional viewpoint for learning the layout of the surrounding terrain.WTA Pro-Tip: On a summer afternoon, uphill hikers may find temperatures on the boulder fields uncomfortably warm. Unless it's a really cool day, consider beginning your hike at an early hour.","driving_directions":"Head east on I-90. Some 44 miles west of Seattle, take Exit 45 (Forest Road 9030.)

However, ice axes, trekking poles, and crampons or microspikes (depending on the season) are required to summit. Hikers who put this investment in will be rewarded with stunning views on a clear day, as well as the satisfaction of having made it up one of Washington's five volcanoes. Many climbers attempt this mountain over two days, beginning their ascent from the trailhead and heading to the Lunch Counter for the first evening. With an early morning wakeup call, they reach the summit early in the day, when the snow is still sturdy from cold overnight temperatures, and head down after snapping some summit shots. It is also possible to camp below Crescent Glacier in the Morrison Creek drainage, to avoid crowd that can form at the Lunch Counter. Begin at the South Climb Trail (183), at the end of a rough forest road (8040-500). Note that the last three miles past Morrison Creek Campground is very rough and narrow, so drive carefully. If you are coming late at night, you may consider camping at Morrison Creek to avoid a late-night car-to-car encounter on the road. From the trailhead, follow an old road bed through the 2012 Cascade Creek burn zone. In times of high wind, this can be a dangerous area, and there is very little shade until you arrive at a stand of trees near the intersection with the Round The Mountain trail. Luckily, this is only about a mile in, and on relatively flat trail, it doesn't take long to arrive there. Because of the exposed nature of the hike, you'll want to bring plenty of water, and consider refilling when you cross Morrison Creek. The summer route up Adams, beyond Morrison Creek becomes rocky and rough. Be sure to have sturdy shoes, since the tread is loose, and can slide out underfoot in steep sections. Traverse this section, then arrive atop a ridgeline northwest of Morrison Creek. The trail continues to climb relentlessly until you reach the snowfields below the Lunch Counter. Continue up to the Lunch Counter. Along the way, there are ample opportunities to throw down your tent, if necessary. Potential tent sites dot the trail from Morrison Creek on. Again, you'll want to be sure you have enough water, or fuel to melt snow, since water sources here are spotty at best.  From the Lunch Counter, it's another grueling climb to Pikers Peak, but that's not all -- Pikers Peak is a false summit that nonetheless can take hours to reach. The wind here can be quite strong, so while you'll be pooped when you reach it, you may not want to stick around too long for your snack break. But you'll want to have some sort of refueling stop before pushing on to the summit. It's a hefty push to the summit cone, and like most mountain climbing ventures, it's thin air towards the top. From the summit, you can see Mounts Jefferson, Hood, St. Helens, and Rainier, and Baker on a clear day. Other peaks spread out in front of you, and despite the chill you may feel from the near-constant breeze at the summit, you'll want to be sure to take plenty of pictures and soak it all in before heading down. WTA Pro Tip: A Cascade Volcano Pass is required May 1st through September 30th for anyone hiking above 7,000 feet, whether or not they are making a summit push. It is $10 for weekday trips and $15 for trips taking place Friday-Sunday. These may be purchased at the Mount Adams Ranger Station in Trout Lake or at the Cowlitz Valley Ranger Station in Randle. If you won't be going above 7,000 feet, then only a Northwest Forest Pass(purchase at ranger station) and Wilderness Permit (free, self-issue at trailhead) are required.","driving_directions":"From Trout Lake, drive on the Mount Adams Road north to a 'V' intersection with Forest Road 23.

An unmarked trail crosses the main road just after the side road. Go down the trail on the left of the road, heading downhill, to get to Mount Molly; the right side, heading uphill, goes to Capitol Peak. Follow this trail along the road for a short time in fairly open territory. Sword ferns and scrubby brush covers the ground nearby, and tall conifers rise up a little distance from the trail. After a short distance, the trail crosses the road again and heads into deeper forest. As the light is partially blocked out by surrounding trees, the trail transforms into a ruddy colored clay chute. Dense sword ferns line the trail, and views of the surrounding hills can be seen through the trees. Continue up at a slow but steady uphill grade until you reach another road. Cross the road to find the trail coming to a three way intersection. Take either the middle or right-hand trail--they connect a little further down. On a clear day Mount Rainier looms huge above the path, and young conifers frame the view. Don't get so carried away with the view that you miss the turnoff to the peak, though. The trail to the top is just a tiny turnoff to the left which is easy to miss coming from this direction. The trail takes a sharp turn in the opposite direction of the main trail, and it's very steep. From here, switchback upward just a little farther to reach the top of this miniature mountain and get views of surrounding hills, the Cascades, and Mount Rainier. If you're lucky, you may see a soaring bald eagle or ruby-crowned kinglets and spotted towhees in the brush. If you do miss the turnoff, you'll continue down the other side of the mountain along the Waddle Creek Basin trail, so if you're heading downhill for any considerable length of time, you'll know to turn back and find the trail to the peak.WTA Pro Tip: Stop to admire the views facing Mount Rainier before you continue on to the top of the mountain and around to the other side to follow the loop trail back to the main trail. There's no lookout spot, so the best views are along the trail when you're almost, but not quite, to the top.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, drive Highway 12 west to Porter Creek Road, which goes right through the small town of Porter.

This quaint trail dispels that myth quite effectively. It ambles easily through forest and meadow, passing pretty woodland lakes and climbing to the high vantage point once utilized by professional fire watchers. Now, lest you ask, the unusual name is truly unique: the name is attributed to two families- who climbed to the summit in 1897. The proud fathers of the Mesler and LaWall families pulled the first initial of each of their combined children and created the name: Burgon, Elizabeth, Lucy, Jessie, Isabel, Clara, and Alex. As the trail lies outside the national park, it is dog friendly.The trail runs steeply up away from the trailhead, slicing upward on rough tread for about 100 yards, before moderating onto a boot-beaten trail along a high ridge. The path drops you at the shores of scenic Lake Christine in 1 mile. Pause here to enjoy the forest-lined lake and the views beyond. With luck, you might see bald eagles or ospreys fishing in this pool.The trail curves around the west shore of the lake and then heads north to a trail junction. Go left here to scramble about 0.5 mile up a rough trail to the summit of Beljica (5478 feet). This old lookout site offers incredible views of Mount Rainier and the many peaks of the Longmire region.","driving_directions":"From Tacoma, drive east on State Route 7 to Elbe, then veer left onto SR 706 to Ashford.

The first fire lookout here was established in 1916; a lowly tent perched on the peak until a cabin with a cupola was built in 1922. This was hit by lightning in 1927 and a second lookout was built, but it was subsequently destroyed in 1965 and never rebuilt. Remains of these structures can still be seen on the mountain, when you can tear yourself away from the view. But you'll have to earn the views on this hike. Even for conditioned hikers this is a physically demanding hike with almost 5,300 feet of elevation gain in a little over five miles. A scramble section with some exposed areas can be treacherous in snow or adverse weather conditions and intimidating to an unseasoned hiker. If you can safely navigate this trail though, the rewards are many.From the trailhead enjoy a pleasant hike through deep forest with several stream crossings. You'll gain a modest 1,300 feet to reach three and a half acre Lake Metan at 1.5 miles. Immediately you will see a \"T\" in the trail when reaching the lake. The trail to the right leads to several primitive camping opportunities while the trail to the left is the main trail. If you look up from the \"T\" you will see your destination high above your head. Lake Metan is the final water source on the trail, so be sure to refill here; you'll need it.From Lake Metan the grade steepens. Continue from the lake under the forest canopy as the trail switchbacks up the mountainside at a calf burning grade, eventually emerging at a boulder field in the basin below Stujack Pass, elevation 4,900 feet. This is a good spot for a break. Enjoy the view of Stujack Pass and listen for pikas squeaking in the boulder field.From the boulder field, continue to Stujack Pass, hiking on talus slopes and through wildflower meadows stocked with Indian paintbrush, aster, yellow monkey flower, lupine, and many more. During your hike in the basin the views open up to Sloan Peak and Three Fingers, and the Sauk River Valley below. Views improve all the way to the summit and sometimes mountain goats can be seen. Beware that the trail is starting to slough off at places here, so avoid taking shortcuts, which can worsen the erosion problem.From the saddle of Stujack Pass, elevation 5,750 feet, enjoy outstanding views. Many hikers will choose to end their hike here -- it's a good stopping point for hikers with pets or people with concerns about heights.If you choose to proceed, leave Stujack Pass and enter Glacier Peak Wilderness, indicated by a weathered sign. From here, the trail turns into a scramble route. Continue around the northeast side of the mountain on a path blasted out of cliffs and on heather slopes. Eventually you will reach the remains of a tram that was used to supply the fire lookout. From this point the trail is exposed and you will continue along a razorback ridge with a permanent snowfield. The White Chuck River Valley spread out below you on your left and the Sauk River Valley on your right. Continue along the knife edge and arrive at a cleft above the glacial trough. Use your hands to continue scrambling, passing an iron ring protruding out of the rock. Sometimes there will be cairns in this section showing the way. This part of the hike is considered a non-technical scramble, but in times of snow or adverse weather conditions it is best left to those with mountaineering experience. If you can negotiate this, the rest of the way is steep but easy to follow.When you finally reach the summit, relax and savor your well-earned achievement. Before you are glorious views in all directions, the most dramatic being Glacier Peak to the east of you. Rest among shards of granite and the remains of the former lookout enjoying one of the best viewpoints in the Cascades.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take exit 208 drive 4 miles east on Hwy 530 to the small town of Arlington.

It’s a fine mountain in its own right too; you’ll ascend nearly 4,000 feet on your way to the top. This is a three-season trail. In late fall, before snow closes the Mountain Loop Highway short of the trailhead, it makes a spectacular snowshoe route. In late spring and early summer, it is the quintessential view hike. And in late summer and early fall, it offers a treasure trove of plump blueberries. Start out at the parking lot Dickerman shares with the Perry Creek trailhead. Large as the parking lot may be, it fills to capacity and beyond on sunny weekends. For the first two or so miles, the trail switchbacks through dense forest. The first part of the trail is enlivened by the occasional rocky outcropping and a spot or two where fallen trees practically form a roof over the trail. After those first two miles, breaks in the forest canopy begin offering up tantalizing views of nearby peaks, like Big Four and Vesper. In another two thirds of a mile, the trail breaks out into the open for a brief series of quick switchbacks before it dives north and heads into a mostly flat section. With the exception of a few zig zags, the trail heads almost straight ahead as it traverses a broad shoulder from the southeast flanks of the mountain to the peak’s west ridge. Unless it hasn’t rained in a very long time, the flat terrain and exposed terrain combine with spring runoff to make for a muddy half of a mile. The trail hits the ridge and stays at or near it for a while. Where it intersects the ridge, be sure to stop and enjoy the views to the north. Particularly striking is the view up the ridge to the cliffs of Dickerman’s summit, hanging high above the Perry Creek drainage. After a third of a mile, the trail heads east, away from the ridge and out into the open, south-facing slopes below the summit. Here, fields of blueberries bask in the sun, making it one of the first places in the Cascades where this scarce crop fully ripens. The trail resorts once again to switchbacks on its steady climb through the meadows, with a brief pause for a side trail to a vantage point with direct views of the summits of Gothic Basin and Monte Cristo. In another third of a mile, you reach the summit ridge. Several groves of trees force a bit of a choice here: stay below the summit and gaze south or stand on the very top and gaze north. There is no bad decision, since views to either direction are spectacular. The summit drops away sharply to the north into the adjacent valleys between Stillaguamish Peak, Mount Forgotten and Twin Peaks. The occasional mountain goat may play peekaboo from the rocky ledges below the summit, but be careful when playing along; the north side of the summit is nothing but a sheer dropoff. Looking back to the west and north, you can scan through all the major peaks of the northern Mountain Loop: Three Fingers, Whitehorse, White Chuck, Pugh and Sloan, while Baker, Shuksan and Glacier Peak hover above and seemingly just beyond. On your way down, the visual trek continues through Monte Cristo, Del Campo, Morningstar, Sperry, Vesper, Big Four, and Pilchuck. With the possible exception of Hidden Lake Lookout, this is the finest summit view around--a rare chance to get so close to so many other summits at the same time. Mount Dickerman may have asked a lot of you to get here, but it will have more than held up its end of the bargain.","driving_directions":"Take the Mountain Loop Highway east out of Granite Falls.

Once your supply has been replenished, begin a relentless climb to the ridge top -- this is a trail to a former fire lookout after all. 3000 feet of gain come in three miles of smooth trail.

Is there still snow lingering there? Do you feel comfortable on the stone steps and exposed rocks? If not, simply end your hike here.

With a half-mile ADA accessible path and another two miles of more rugged wandering, the Mima Mounds are a great destination for many hikers. Many theories exist as to what created the Mima Mounds. Everything from geologic forces to extraterrestrial have been cited to explain the strange lumps that carpet the 445-acres of this National Natural Landmark. For a short, educational visit, head to the observation deck and half mile long paved trail. This is perfect for little ones, who may be more interested in speculating what created the mound than exploring them. If you're looking for a more thorough exploration of the area, a 1.5-mile loop trail to the south wends among, around, and even over some of the mounds. As you hike, keep an eye out for the fluffy mosses and lichen, low-growing prairie grasses, and the charred remains of trees. These are the result of prescribed, managed burns carried out by the Department of Natural Resources, in the tradition of the Native peoples who used to manage the land in this area. It's an effort to manage not only native plants, but also the invasive Scotch Broom plant. View of Mount Rainier and even Mount St. Helens are possible when it's clear. If the south loop wasn't enough, there's another half-mile loop to the north. Simply circle back to the observation deck and consult the map. The trail for the northern loop takes off a few steps to the west. WTA Pro Tip: The Mima Mounds are an excellent destination in almost any season, but they're truly beautiful in spring, when camas and other wildflowers cloak them in beautiful purples and blues.","driving_directions":"Drive south on I-5 to to exit 95.

The tract of wetlands is well-preserved despite being close to town, making the park an attraction for bird-watchers and plant-lovers of the city of Olympia.Begin the ramble by parking in front of a fence in a small gravel parking lot. A small map immediately inside the fence illustrates the trails in the park. Head across an open field to a large sign, which describes some of the park’s animals. Ducks, such as buffleheads, and other waterfowl can be found in Grass Lake, and songbirds like black-throated grey warblers, common yellowthroats, and various sparrows can be found in the forest brush and wetland bushes. About 100 bird species have been recorded in the 171 acre refuge, along with over 200 species of plants.At the large sign, turn left down a short boot path to see a view of Grass Lake or continue straight along the main trail. After about 0.2 miles, approach a three-way junction and a map. Turn left to go to the lakeshore again, this time to see the lake from a different angle, and then return to the junction. Go straight or turn right for the one-mile loop trail. The trail meanders through a vibrant-green mix of salal, Oregon grape, sword fern, and a wealth of deciduous shrubs. Both conifers and deciduous trees, coated in a multitude of mosses and lichens, tower overhead in the second and third-growth forest. The forest opens enough for more light to filter through at about .5 miles into the loop, where wetland habitat is evident to the left of the trail. This is the Western patch of Grass Lake’s wetland.

You'll walk through a serene willow forest, marvel at the power of nature when you encounter twisted hulks of logging machinery, and see plenty of gnarled stumps where tall evergreens once stood.Despite several pushes for National Park status, Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument falls under the supervision of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The Forest Service does the best they can with limited resources, but most of the dollars are directed to the main Visitor Center at Johnston Ridge Observatory, at the end of Spirit Lake Highway (State Route 504). There, on a sunny weekend, you'll hear dozens of languages as throngs of tourists wander the interpretive exhibits and nature paths. The Visitor Center is well worth a visit if time allows following your hike. It is $8.00 per person, or free admission for one with an annual Northwest Forest Pass or America the Beautiful Pass.Back to the hiking! South Coldwater Trail 230A starts from a medium-sized parking lot off Spirit Lake Highway. Leave Fido at home—pets are not allowed on this hike. And please keep to the established trail throughout your visit. This fragile landscape will take decades to heal, and a stray bootprint in the fine ash leaves a bad impression for other visitors. If the day is warm be sure to pack extra water—you will find none on this trail. The area is frequented by herds of elk in late spring. As you ascend you'll see large poles that mark the way and serve as confidence markers to keep you off the occasional crisscrossing game trails. Climb moderately, then more steeply through a shady forest of willows to arrive at the rusting remains of a logging caterpillar, with the crater of Mount St. Helens in the background to the south. Continue up the ridge for views down to Coldwater Lake and north to the Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center—mothballed for several years, but now a learning and science center for education and conservancy groups. You'll follow old roadbed for another mile. In late summer, ripe huckleberry bushes will slow your pace. Look left shortly before the junction with Lakes Trail 211—you might miss an old bulldozer set askew from the volcanic blast. The junction is your turnaround point, but check in with your legs. If you're feeling adventuresom, press on. Another two miles down the trail to the left will take you down to a bridge over Coldwater Creek. Another steep mile down the righthand trail takes you to Ridge Camp, one of eight reservable camps in the Mount Margaret Backcountry and Coldwater Saddle, with stunning views of the ridges and valleys north of the mountain. Back at the trailhead, take a few moments to stretch and dust yourself off—you’re likely covered in volcanic ash! If time allows, stop by the Coldwater Lake picnic area to clean up and walk the Birth of a Lake Nature Trail, a half-mile concrete path and boardwalk that is ADA-accessible. A loop hike is possible by adding Lakes Trail 211 and fully circumnavigating Coldwater Lake. This is best done with a group and a car drop or key exchange, with cars at the South Coldwater trailhead and the Coldwater Lake boat launch. You could walk the shy mile from the boat launch to the South Coldwater trailhead, but it involves a dicey road walk along SR 504, with cars, motorcycles, tour buses and motorhomes blasting by you. Expect about 10 miles and 2,000 feet of cumulative gain. WTA Pro Tip: If you’re on this hike at the peak of summer heat, pocket some hard candy or mints to keep the saliva flowing between gulps of water. For supper, enjoy an elk burger and berry cobbler with views of the Toutle River at Patty’s Place at 19-Mile House.

Though it clears early in the season, this may not be the best option for those looking for an easy walk -- the trail is rugged and requires scrambling in places. From the trailhead in Diablo, the trail immediately sets off along Stetattle, a cold, rushing creek -- perhaps more aptly called a river. You will walk past a housing area before entering the forest, and shortly after entering the forest, arrive at a washed-out section of trail. A landslide on the opposite side of the creek resulted in high water that wrecked the trail, which means it now requires a bit of a scramble to cross the washed-out section.But beyond the washout, the trail is perfectly walkable. After 1.6 miles, the trail begins a switchbacking climb that rises several hundred feet above creek level. The narrow, mossy trail eventually levels out and traverses the slope of Sourdough Mountain in dry forest. There are glimpses of huge snowy peaks looming above, but views are limited for the most part.Every so often, the trail crosses creeks tumbling down from the snowy heights above. The streams that feed Stetattle Creek originate high in the glaciers of McMillan Spires and Davis Peak. When the snowpack is heavy, the spring melt can swell these creeks to impassable -- use your best judgement as you press on. The trail eventually peters out after 3 miles. ","driving_directions":"On Highway 20, proceed to milepost 126 and turn into the town of Diablo. Note: this is different than Diablo Dam.

On a clear day, the exposed summit provides outstanding views all around and down. The trail is moderately steep but short, following Sawtooth Ridge 1.6 miles to the summit, where a fire lookout cabin clings to the top.Bring water, as there is none along the trail, and no amenities whatsoever at the trailhead. After parking, a look around Towhead Gap will reveal two battered trailhead signs, on opposite sides of the road. You want the one on the northwest side, where the road first widens to form the parking area. The sign may still be legible: “High Rock Lookout Trail 266.” Immediately to the right is what looks like an wider trail heading up. Ignore it; it narrows into an eroding boot path that connects with the main trail in a tenth of a mile.The main trail starts out somewhat narrow, and lined with vegetation. After connecting with the boot path, it follows the ridgeline up, entering a forest of young fir and hemlock that provides shade for most of the climb. The trail is adequately wide the rest of the way. Huckleberries are plentiful along the lower part. Bear grass, trilliums, and penstemon are less common.The ascent is moderately steep and has few switchbacks, climbing steadily to the north-northwest just below or along the crest of Sawtooth Ridge. The tread is good, with few roots or rocks to contend with. At 0.7 and 0.9 miles are wooden benches, offering a convenient place to rest. From here on, the trail steepens, as trailside vegetation thins in favor of larger trees.At 1.3 miles, the trail tops the ridgeline at a rock outcropping and viewpoint. A steep drop-off prevents getting an easy view of the summit, but it is close. Continue up the west side of the ridge top, passing below the visible lookout cabin, to the northern edge of Sawtooth Ridge, where the sheerness of the northern face becomes apparent. Turn right for the final 200 yards, onto the large and flat sloped rock that the lookout building is fastened to. The cabin was built in 1929, but is no longer staffed. Building occupancy is prohibited due to the lack of lightning protection.The United States Geological Survey classifies High Rock as a “pillar”, a “vertical, standing, often spire-shaped, natural rock formation”. The exposure on this pillar is worthy of caution; there are no longer any cables to protect you from a sheer vertical drop, as much as 600 feet on the north side. Enjoy the views from the rock or from the wraparound deck of the lookout cabin. Mount Rainier is to the northeast, as is Cora Lake, over 1800 feet below you.

When the hydroelectric project near Ross Lake was under construction during the 1930s and '40s, owner and developer J.D. Ross built a trail to nearby Ladder Creek Falls to showcase the area. The falls and surrounding gardens quickly became a tourist attraction, illuminated at night with colored lights and livened up by music that was piped in on Friday evenings for visitors who came from Seattle for a night out. The light show remains an attraction, running a 15 minute repeating program from dusk until midnight year-round, but the falls are enjoyable at any time, day or night. After the construction of the Powerhouse, the falls lost much of their volume to the dam upstream. But because the diversion is above the falls, enough water remains in glacier-fed Ladder Creek to allow for year-round flow. There are signs marking the short informative trail near the powerhouse.

Stimulated by the breathtaking scenery at the summit, beatnik poets Gary Snyder and Philip Whalen, who worked as lookouts during the 1950s, each found Sourdough Mountain to be their muse. The current lookout tower, built in 1933 and restored in 1998, is listed on the National Historic Lookout Register.The trail to Sourdough’s summit wastes no time letting its true intention be known: to climb up and out of the towering conifers into open meadowlands with breathtaking views galore. In the first 2 miles alone, hikers will be faced with a climb of 3,000 vertical feet. The grueling switchbacks will seem endless, but rest assured they are not. The forest gradually thins, offering some motivating peekaboo views of what lies ahead.At 4 miles, carefully cross rushing Sourdough Creek, the trail’s first water source, before continuing your ascent on more gently graded tread. Alternating through charming groves of sub-alpine forest and wide-open expanses of vibrant wildflowers, you will be so occupied taking in views of the glaciated peaks that line the horizon, you’ll scarcely remember how much effort you expended to reach this point.One last push through a series of switchbacks brings you to the broad summit of Sourdough Mountain. Linger a while and be rejuvenated by the 360-degree views sprawling before you. Mount Prophet and Hozomeen Mountain dominate the northern skyline, while Jack Mountain rises to 9,000 feet in the east, the jagged Picket Range lines the horizon to the west, and to the south, Pyramid and Colonial Peaks jut high above the turquoise waters of Diablo Lake, nearly a vertical mile below.","driving_directions":"From Marblemount, drive SR 20 east for 20 miles.

This way, you'll enjoy a wider, more well-maintained trail, and you're more likely to share it with Pacific Crest Trail thru-hikers. From the trailhead just off Highway 20, set out on wide, moderately steep trail. At first, you're hiking through a dark, deep forest, hopping creeks and listening to waterfalls. The first mile and a half is crossed by a handful of small creeks, but even in late fall these can run high. It's a good idea to have hiking poles with you. It's not until 1.5 miles in that you cross your biggest creek -- Porcupine Creek. Look for the safest way across and then continue on, now beginning to head more directly towards the pass. As you climb, the forest thins, and you can see across the valley to craggy mountain spires. At the first open point, turn around and gaze across the highway. Those big, blocky peaks are Black and Fisher, as well as several others. Continue on after gazing at the stunning scenery. Cross the valley to it's south side, and begin climbing switchbacks. After a handful of these, the trail traverses back across the valley to the north and resumes switchbacking, though the grade has lessened. You're approaching the pass, but it'll take a final push through some of the most scenic land the state has to offer. The wide open valley is dotted with granite boulders, spots of huckleberry bushes, and the dark green heather indicative of this high alpine environment. In the pass itself, you're spoiled for choices of lunch spot. Everywhere you turn offers up gorgeous views, including down: that little blue pool in the valley below is Cutthroat Lake, another way to access this grandiose area. Pick a granite slab, plop down, and relish what you worked so hard to enjoy.","driving_directions":"Drive east on the North Cascades Highway (Highway 20) for 51 miles to Rainy Pass.

The trail spans the width of the Pasayten Wilderness and is part of the much larger Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. The combination of stunning scenery and lack of crowds is one of the BT’s most enticing aspects especially in autumn, when colors are changing, temperatures are cooling and bugs are gone. A number of places along the trail are so special that you’ll have the images etched into your memory for years to come.Starting at the Irongate trailhead west of Loomis—and doing the trip east to west—means reaching the hallowed meadows of Horseshoe Basin on the first day of your trip. You’ll reach the portal of 7,200-foot Sunny Pass at 5.2 miles and the view of the vast meadows will be but an introduction to the scenic feast ahead. Camping is available at several places in the basin, but in late season Loudon Lake may be the only available water. From Horseshoe Basin, the Canadian border is just a mile away via easy cross-country travel. Continuing westward over mostly open terrain with views, the Tungsten Mine is reached at 21 miles. Several rusty mining relics can be found near the trail. When you reach Apex Pass a few miles farther, you’re presented with your first views of craggy Cathedral Peak, unlike anything else in the Pasayten. At 26 miles you’ll reach 7,600-ft Cathedral Pass, then head down to upper Cathedral Lake near the base of the impressive 8,360-foot Amphitheater Mountain. Camping is good here, and you’ll want time to savor the ambiance. If you’ve built in a layover day, or have a few hours to spare, consider the extra few miles for the unmarked trail up the south side of Amphitheater Mountain. This horse trail goes nearly to the top and the views include most of the Pasayten Wilderness. Leaving the Cathedral Lakes behind, the views continue as you hike west, with bulky 8,685-foot Remmel Mountain being front and center. This is followed by a long descent to the log crossing over the Ashnola River at 38 miles. Across the river is a 2,000 foot climb to more big meadows near 6,900-foot Peeve Pass at 42 miles. Following the pass, trail conditions begin to deteriorate before it climbs right over the top of 7,240-foot Bunker Hill. Stop for lunch here before descending a bit more than 3,000 feet to the Pasayten River. Ford the river—a detour downstream may be necessary—then hike upstream for 7 miles to the site of the old Three Forks Cabin. Here is a pivotal trail junction where three streams of the Pasayten come together.One of the biggest challenges of hiking the entire 80-plus-mile Boundary Trail is where to exit. The “official” ending descends to Ross Lake via the Castle Pass and Lightning Creek trails. However, this section receives little maintenance and is not recommended. From Three Forks Junction, one option heads south up the Middle Fork Pasayten Trail to exit via Slate Pass. Hiking out via the West Fork Pasayten Trail exits near Slate Peak. Two other options provide access to the Pacific Crest Trail via either Woody Pass or Holman Pass. From Holman Pass, longer options exist to hike over Devils Dome to Ross Lake or McMillan Park to Hwy 20.Hiking out via the mostly forested Middle Fork Pasayten River is the shortest way out to the Slate Pass trailhead (Harts Pass area, 80 hiking miles from Irongate).WTA Pro Tip: If you like to get off the trail and scramble easy summits, the Boundary Trail was made for you. At 8,100 feet, Armstrong Mountain is a long mile from Horseshoe Basin and takes you right to U.S.–Canadian border. Haig Mountain is higher, but Teapot Dome at 7,610 feet is just a half-mile from the Boundary Trail. 8,300 foot-high Apex Mountain is almost mandatory, given the legendary views of Cathedral Peak. From the 7,100-foot pass, Bald Mountain looms 7,930 feet high over the Ashnola River, and Sheep Mountain, at 8,275 feet, near Peeve Pass will each take at least a few hours of your time.","driving_directions":"To hike the BT in its entirety, you’ll need to consider the logistics to accomplish this 80-plus mile one-way hike. There are several possibilities for arranging transportation—from finding a friend who isn’t hiking to assist with shuttling, or doing a key swap with another hiker.

Infected trees have weakened root systems that can cause them to fall unpredictably. When such infections are detected in a developed area where people gather (trail heads, viewing platforms, benches, campgrounds etc.) they are required to either close the \"gathering\" area or fell the trees to avoid liability.Rather than fell old-growth trees to comply with their policy, the Forest Service made the decision to close the trail. Sadly, as far as we know there is no plan to revive this trail nor any sign that policies about risk and hazard tree management will change in the foreseeable future.","driving_directions":"","distance":"1.5 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"46.0939","longitude":"-121.907266667","elevation_gain":"300","highest_point":"1900"},{"features":["Wildflowers/Meadows","Mountain views","Rivers"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/south_cascades.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//46.2884,-121.5528/@46.2884,-121.5528,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/12695029_1511122722526269_6111006237925129945_o-copy.jpg/@@images/4a6bb298-2045-4dc3-a37d-2f7c67aa6279.jpeg","region":"South Cascades","current_rating":"3.89 out of 5","name":"Adams Creek Meadows","trail_description":"Although it can get crowded on the weekends, there is plenty of room for seclusion on either a day hike or an overnight stay.

Forget about the busy highway and the railroad as you enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in a quarter mile. Just a little farther down the trail, cross Deception Creek on a beautiful log bridge. With carved steps leading to a wide footbridge with a hand railing, kids will love this one! Across the creek, large boulders make a nice place to rest and throw rocks in the water.Once across the creek, continue hiking through magnificent old-growth forest. The trail leaves the river now and heads up and over the cliff. You can hear the river below as you switchback up through moss-covered boulders and ferny undergrowth. This mossy forest floor is home to many types of plants. Look for the showy white flowers of trillium in spring. In addition to the more traditionally recognizable flowers, plants with no chlorophyll that live on decaying organic matter thrive here. Watch for a ground-hugging leaf with a white stripe down the middle: the rattlesnake orchid. Come back in the summer and look for its bloom, tubular white flowers on a short stalk. The forest floor also is home to a colorful saprophyte called pine drops, whose flowers are salmon-yellow urn shaped flowers on an orange stem. Another saprophyte, pinesap, is similar in color but shorter. In the fall this same forest floor will also support a variety of mushrooms. The trail drops down a little to a nice campsite, and short of three miles, there will be another log footbridge. Cross the bridge over Sawyer creek and notice the abundance of huckleberry bushes. Pick a few to add to pancakes. If you're camping, this is a reminder to bearproof your food in your site-they like the berries as much as you do.Continue on as the trail takes a gentle up and down course along the ridge. As you approach the river again, listen for the loud roaring sound that indicates a waterfall. The river falls in several short steps, reaches a narrow chasm, then churns through it. Picture time! Play with your camera settings and try to capture it in motion, but be careful when lining up the shot; the drop off is steep and the moss slippery. Once you pass the waterfall the trail drops down, breaks out of the woods and into an old avalanche ravine. Here may be some views of the surrounding peaks, if the weather is cooperating. Keep heading down along the flats and reach the river again in five and a half miles. There will be a trail junction and a sign. The right side climbs the ridge to Sawyer Pass and Tonga Ridge. Follow the left fork to some nice campsites along the river. Eat lunch here and call it a day, or proceed along with a backpack to meet the Pacific Crest Trail at Deception Pass or Deception Lakes.WTA Pro Tip: No hike along the Highway 2 corridor would be complete without a stop at Zeke’s Drive In for a burger and shake.","driving_directions":"Head east toward Stevens Pass on Hwy 2.

Reach a summit with views toward the north, from Mount Si to Mailbox Peak, and several other peaks in between. Some hikers judge Cedar Butte to be a better viewpoint than the much-visited West Tiger 3 summit, and it requires less effort and has smaller crowds, so when you are ready for a change of scene check it out.From the parking area, walk past the privies and informational bulletin boards, and follow signs to the John Wayne Pioneer Trail / Iron Horse State Park. The former railroad grade is wide and graveled, and gets some traffic from mountain bikers. The first part of the trail borders the Cedar River Watershed (a City of Seattle drinking water source,) and frequent signs threaten dire consequences to any who trespass there. In a similar tone, pet owners are alerted that the leash law is strictly enforced ($87 fine.)In less than a mile from the trailhead, cross Boxley Creek on a bridge edged with heavy wire mesh siding. About 100 feet beyond the bridge, a wide area on the right looks like it could lead to a trail, but that's not it. Continue on another 200 yards and find the signed Cedar Butte Trail on the right. The Green Trails map 205S (2004 edition) indicates this is Department of Natural Resources Land, but the sign at the beginning of the trail says it is part of Olallie State Park. (Perhaps state agency boundaries have changed.)Follow the Cedar Butte Trail uphill and, in about 0.3 miles, come to an unsigned trail fork. Both branches lead to Cedar Butte, but the left fork is more direct. The right fork is about a half-mile longer, and detours past the site of the \"Boxley Blowout,\" a 1918 power dam failure that destroyed the logging community of Edgewick, with no fatalities. For more information, see the History Link site.Only the left branch of the Cedar Butte Trail is shown on the Green Trails Map. The two branches reconnect at the signed Saddle Junction, and the trail continues on, via several switchbacks, toward the summit. Near the top, you might get a glimpse of Rattlesnake Lake through the trees.On the final approach to the summit, the trail narrows and follows along the upper edge of the steep north face of Cedar Butte. At the summit there are two very low log seats, and a USGS Bench Mark from 1937 stamped with the imaginative spelling \"Ceder Butt.\"The summit is forested, but there are views out toward the north looking up the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River, with Mount Si, Mount Teneriffe, Green Mountain, Russian Butte and Mailbox Peak all visible.When you are ready to descend, note a small sign with an arrow that points out an alternative trail. It avoids the narrow section along the steep north face of the butte, and soon rejoins the main trail. (But, unless the upcoming trail is crowded, this is just an option, and you might as well descend the main trail.)

And the views are explosive—from Mount St. Helens looming immediately above you to snowcapped Mount Adams floating over emerald ridges in the distance.Locate a gated road heading south—that’s the Truman Trail, your route. Here it starts off on an old roadbed, hugging Windy Ridge’s eastern slopes high above the Smith Creek drainage. Thick rows of alder line the way, colonizing the landscape disturbed by the 1980 blast. Most of the trail, however, still remains fairly open, granting nearly continuous views from St. Helens to other Cascade volcanoes in the distance.Pass some seismic measuring equipment and lots of dangling culverts. The way climbs about 200 feet before slowly descending. After 1.7 miles, reach a junction (elev. 4150 ft). You’ll be returning from the right, so continue left on the Abraham Trail as it straddles a narrow ridge. After a slight descent, the way steeply climbs via a series of sand ladders.

Then continue along the narrow ridge, dropping 50 feet before climbing again to top out at around 4570 feet. The way then wraps around the ridge’s grassy eastern slopes, dipping in and out of several gullies on a downward trajectory to the Plains of Abraham. Pass clusters of colonizing firs and mountain ash. In summer a myriad of wildflowers paints the slopes, while huckleberry bushes set it on fire in autumn.After crossing Smith Creek (elev. 4350 ft) and the rocky outwash of the Nelson Glacier, reach a junction (elev. 4475 ft) with the around Mount St. Helens Loowit Trail at 3.9 miles. Here spread out before you is the Plains of Abraham, a near-level expanse named not for the father figure of biblical fame but after the famed battlefield in Quebec City. An early adventurer here saw some semblance, but certainly the plains in Quebec sont plus vertes! In early summer, the pumiced plains are painted purple thanks to a proliferation of lupine.You can saunter out across the plain if you’d like, before continuing on your way. Head right on the Loowit Trail, to skirt the edge of the plains. Recross Smith Creek and a series of outwashes, some of them resembling arroyos. Admire St. Helens before you with the Dogs Head in clear view. Before the 1980 eruption, the Dogs Head route was the standard way to climb St. Helens.Begin climbing now across patches of pumice and scree, which will tax your stride. The trail traverses ledges prone to slides too, so use caution.

Suddenly, laid out beneath your feet are the icy waters of the lake–-deep blue in the shade, bright aquamarine in sunlight–-while high above you at the far end of the lake, the twin spires of Dragontail and Colchuck Peaks seem to crowd out the very sky. And all this is within relatively easy reach. While the final ascent to the lake is steep and rough in places, Colchuck’s overall elevation gain of 2,300 feet makes its spectacular scenery accessible to hikers of almost any ability. In summer, cars fill not only the trailhead parking lot, but the road leading to it. As if Colchuck Lake alone weren’t enough of a draw, it is one of the two gateways to the Enchantments, and the trailhead also accesses Stuart Lake, an easier and equally awesome destination. Begin on the Stuart Lake Trail #1599. The first mile and a half climbs very gradually in forest, first dense and dark, then thinner and lighter, within earshot and sometimes sightline of Mountaineer Creek. Occasional breaks in the trees offer glimpses of the steep walls of the valley. At the end of this first mile and a half, the trail crosses to the right bank of Mountaineer Creek on a sturdy log bridge. On hot days, standing at the midpoint of the bridge, hikers can catch some welcome relief from the breeze coming off the rushing whitewater of the creek. After the bridge, the route steepens and grows rockier, a small taste of what’s to come over the hike’s second half. Three quarters of a mile later, the trail flattens out and drops a little before reaching a trail junction. Straight ahead the path to Stuart Lake rolls out, while the Colchuck Lake Trail #1599.1 breaks off to the left. Follow the trail to the left and after a short stretch in the trees, come to another log bridge that takes you across a narrow, turbulent section of Mountaineer Creek. The trail is a bit of a jumble as you hop boulders in a large talus slope along the creek’s bank. A short distance later you near the creek again, but here its waters turn suddenly glassy smooth; a nice spot for a meditative pause before starting to climb once again. At first, the trail switchbacks gently, but the closer it gets to the lake, the steeper and rockier it gets. At several spots along the way, views open up, first to the valley you’ve just climbed out of, then up to the toothy ridge of Dragontail Peak. After one final steep stretch, the trail takes a jog to the right, drops into a small swale and suddenly, there you are at one of the finest lake views in the Cascades. The trail seems to end at a broad granite face overlooking the lake. This is a great place to grab lunch and take in the scenery. Immediately across the lake is the imposing massif of Dragontail Peak. To the left of Dragontail is Aasgard Pass, the climb that serves as the unbelievably steep “shortcut” to the Enchantments. To the right are the remnants of the Colchuck Glacier and the slopes of Colchuck Peak, its true summit tucked out of view behind rocky towers. The trail continues along the lakeshore another two thirds of a mile, at times rough and a little hard to follow. One of the least obvious route junctures is at a large tarn -– it’s a common mistake to follow the well-trodden dirt to the right, but the trail actually proceeds over rocky slopes to the left. After a series of bends and ups and downs in the trees, the trail reaches a rock field at the bottom of the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier. Here, subalpine firs give way to larches, and the formal trail gives way to a rock-hopping route that eventually heads up Aasgard Pass. WTA Pro Tip: There are campsites all along the lakeshore, but be aware that camping here is managed under the same strict regime as the core Enchantment Zone -– overnight stays are by permit only from May 15th-October 31st.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

While the trail will make you work, the reward at the end is well worth the sweat. When you reach the lowest of the Thornton Lakes you’ll be faced with a decision: relax near the alpine waters, or scramble the rocky ridge that leads to Trappers Peak. Either way, you can’t go wrong. Keep in mind, if you want to overnight here, you'll need a backcountry permit from the ranger station in Marblemount. The trail starts modestly, traversing the hillside through the forest and crossing a couple creeks with minimal elevation gain. Look closely and you’ll notice remnants of the decommissioned logging road you’re hiking on as you ramble along the first two miles. When you reach the end of the road, the trail will start to your left and begin to gain elevation. This section switchbacks through dense forest, and careful footing is needed to avoid the numerous roots that protrude into the trail. At roughly mile four you’ll enter North Cascades National Park, where the trail will continue to climb until you reach a signed junction. Here you’ll need to decide if you want to spend some time by the lake, or continue ascending for sweeping panoramic views. If you choose the lake, head left at the junction and travel downhill for roughly half a mile to reach the lowest of the Thornton Lakes. If you decide to scramble the peak, take the right fork and get ready to gain some more elevation. The scramble to Trappers Peak will take you almost 1,000 feet higher in less than a mile before you can enjoy the views. The trail to the peak is rugged, and at times requires the use of your hands to assist the climb. There isn’t much to speak of in exposure, but use careful footing, as there are sections where taking a fall could mean tumbling downhill a good ways.As you reach the top, just under 6,000 feet, you’ll be treated to sweeping views of a number of North Cascades gems. In front of you, the Picket Range, with spiny, dagger-like peaks and dramatic glaciers. To the west, Mount Triumph looms above and the upper Thornton Lakes are visible down below. Turning around, you’ll find incredible views of the Skagit River and farmlands stretching as far as you can see, and the town of Newhalem can be spotted nestled alongside Highway 20.WTA Pro Tip: A backcountry permit is required to camp here.

Jackson wilderness. The vibrant blue of the glacier-fed lake provides the perfect rest stop for hikers who have braved the thirty-odd, steep switchbacks that lead to the lake. The trail starts in cool second growth forest, but the trees are quite sizable. In the fall, the squirrels roughhouse in the trees high above your head. Occasionally they drop gigantic pinecones from high above, and while the resulting crash is startling, it is fun to watch.The trail is in excellent shape, and gets right down to business, starting off venturing through a close forest with very little understory, but lots of moss. As you climb, you move swiftly from one steep but well-designed switchback to another, and yet another, gaining a little under 3,000 feet in a little under 3 miles. While this can be draining, rewards await you at the top. Huckleberry bushes line the trail, and tired hikers can stop and munch on the sweet treats their their heart's content. After three miles, the trail reaches a ridgeline with a set of switchbacks heading up a rocky face. If you look to the east, some stellar views of the mountains can be seen, and on a clear day Glacier Peak graces hikers with an up-close and personal view.Once you've conquered the ridgeline, most of your climbing is over. The trail continues much more gently through sub-alpine flower meadows that glow with lupine when in season. Eventually, the trail drops to pretty but stagnant Virgin Lake. There is no inlet or outlet, so the water is entirely snowmelt and rainwater, and by late fall the water is more like a bog. Often, this is a breeding ground for frogs and salamanders, so keep your eyes peeled for plenty of amphibian friends.WTA trail crews have had backcountry response teams (BCRTs) working to improve this section of trail for three summers, but use caution in wet weather as small sections can still be muddy, rocky, rooty, and steep, dropping 600 feet in 0.6 miles. If you can tear your eyes away from the trail, the view will take your breath away. Across the valley is the foot of Columbia Peak, and ss you round the last point, beautiful Blanca Lake opens up in all her glory. The lake is framed to the north by the peaks of Monte Cristo, Columbia, and Keyes. More than a few hikers have been known to gasp aloud when they round the corner and see the robin-egg blue waters. Above the lake, the Columbia Glacier drains via a twin waterfall into the vibrantly blue colored water. It's the glacial till in the water that lends the lake its otherworldly color. At at the end of the trail lies a small beach full of driftwood, perfect for relaxing and enjoying the beauty that surrounds you. Here pikas and marmots abound, watching like sentinels from large boulders fallen from the peaks high above.WTA Pro Tip: Blanca Lake is an extremely popular trail. If you decide to visit, you can enjoy a quieter destination by heading for Toil Peak, attainable from the saddle just above Virgin Lake. Instead of heading downhill toward Virgin and Blanca Lakes, head up and west for views of Glacier, Kyes and Monte Cristo Peaks, as well as Blanca Lake's robin-egg blue glowing in all its glory.","driving_directions":"ALERT: Trailhead is inaccessible due to washouts west of Garland Mineral Spring.  ---Take US Hwy 2 east from Monroe to just past the town of Skykomish.

As far as miles per hour goes, Aasgard may be one of the slowest hikes you attempt. Achieving the pass is a thigh-burning, chest-bursting, eye-popping endeavor that offers as many extraordinary views as beads of sweat that will fall  from your brow as you ascend nearly 2000 feet in just three-quarters of a mile. From Colchuck Lake, a trail has been tramped out by the hundreds of feet that head up and over Aasgard Pass each year. While it’s relatively evident to those familiar with route-finding, this is not the trail for folks new to hiking, no matter your level of fitness. You’ll need route-finding experience, agility, and excellent balance. Those lucky enough to score a permit for the Core Zone should consider these factors when you’re thinking about heading in over Aasgard Pass for an overnight. While it may be considerably shorter mileage-wise, the trail up Aasgard can be treacherous if your center of balance is compromised by a pack loaded with overnight gear. Rock-hopping around the head of Colchuck Lake gives way to a trail with a staircase-like grade. Further on, sections of scrambling are required to ultimately access the coveted Core Zone. The pass viewed from the lake is not the real top of the pass but instead a false summit, with even more elevation gain to be had before gaining the pass.But once you’re atop the pass, the striped rocks, gleaming snow, jagged peaks, and icy lakes that lie before you make it seem like you’re in another world--even on another planet. The basin is so huge that other hikers seem like little ants below you at Isolation Lake, and sound is quickly absorbed into the air around you, giving the impression of solitude despite the fact that you’re probably sharing the basin with at least a few other people. At 7800 feet, it seems like you’re on top of the world, though Dragontail Peak rises above to the west and a large ridgeline looms overhead to the east. WTA Pro Tip: Many people attempt the Enchantments as a one-day traverse, departing from the Lake Stuart trailhead and making the Snow Lakes trailhead their destination. If this is your goal, leave early! Hiking up Aasgard Pass is tiring, but doing so in the heat of the day (between 11am and 3pm) is even worse, and once you arrive at the pass, you still have 15 miles of trail to negotiate before arriving at Snow Lake trailhead. The sooner you can get Aasgard over with, the more time you’ll have to enjoy your route out of this singular landscape.","driving_directions":"Drive Hwy 2 to milepost 99, found on the western edge of the Bavarian village of Leavenworth.

But the whole package includes old-growth forest, gorgeous wildflowers, and stunning views into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness from both sides of the pass below Kendall Peak, where the Katwalk begins.Start out from the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) main parking lot, passing a picnic table in the shade, and coming upon a ‘T’.  Stay to the right; the left is merely the connector trail from the upper parking lot. In another 100 feet, pass a gravelly overgrown trail on the left. This is the unmaintained Commonwealth Creek Trail, a portion of the original Cascade Crest Trail, the precursor to the PCT.You'll continue on along the wide trail, climbing gently past the lush and varied vegetation lining the trail. In late August or early September, blueberries are a treat. The trail winds around at first, then heads into a series of lengthy straight sections. The second section passes through forest still exhibiting damage from the summer storm of 2011, when the trail had to be closed briefly in order to clear gigantic blowdowns.Approaching the 2-mile mark, the trail breaks out into open talus, enters the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, then begins slowly dropping 100 feet. At 2.25 miles, a small waterfall on the steep uphill side of the trail alerts you to the stream crossings ahead. Two sequential crossings are aided by good balance and/or trekking poles. In high runoff, there is not enough room to avoid minor splashing. As always, be safe when crossing high water, and if it seems too much for you, don't be afraid to turn around. 500 feet beyond, stay right at the signed junction and climb to a switchback, entering shady forest. After crossing a stream (the same one as below), the trail briefly follows a gravelly runoff bed into a rock formation. The trail can be lost here; watch for where it dodges sharply to the right, sometimes hidden in shadows. Continue on through old-growth forest, where blacktail deer roam stealthily.At 4.25 miles, cross a nearly flat ridge top where large fallen trees bear evidence to a past storm. Camping is possible here, but there is no water. Traverse a steep hillside through beautiful old-growth forest, eventually breaking out into open talus at about 5000 feet of elevation.  In season, the slopes feature a dazzling array of wildflowers, including lupine, paintbrush, phlox, penstemon, and columbine. This area is affectionately known as Kendall Gardens. The trail is steep, rocky, and exposed, offering unobstructed views of Lundin Peak and Red Mountain ahead, and Mount Rainier behind. At 5400 feet, the trail turns a corner to the right and changes heading to almost due east. Along the final up-and-down half mile, lingering snow can make the way treacherous; check trail conditions.Cross the pass below Kendall Peak and welcome new views.

The forest lands of Blanchard Mountain became state trust lands in the 1920s and 1930s, giving the forest a needed respite. Much of the forest on Blanchard is second-growth; logging artifacts can be seen on the trail, and giant stumps inspire imagination about the towering cathedral forests that blanketed the mountain prior to logging.Access to Oyster Dome is best from the Samish Overlook parking area on Blanchard Mountain. It's a bit of a rough road to get there, but the views from the beginning and end of the hike are well worth it.From the trailhead, head northwest on a section of the Pacific Northwest Trail, entering the second-growth forest of Blanchard Mountain. In 0.4 miles, descend 190 feet to the junction with the Samish Bay Connector and turn right. You ascend as the trail switchbacks steeply through second-growth alder, Western redcedar, and Douglas fir forest. Logging artifacts can be seen on the trail, and giant stumps inspire imagination what grew on Blanchard prior to logging. The elevation gain briefly becomes gentler as you cross several small creeks. This area receives substantial rainfall, and the Washington Conservation Corps has built turnpikes to reduce the numbers of waterspots and mudholes. After another one-half mile, the grade steepens, and switchbacks fortified by rock walls lift you past giant boulders. Here, formerly rooty and slippery sections have been bypassed or rehabilitated by WTA volunteers in 2014, 2015, and 2016. 1.9 miles from the Samish Overlook, you will come to a junction with the trail to Lily and Lizard Lakes. A turn to the right takes you to the lakes; but you'll continue to the left on the trail to Oyster Dome, which is now one-quarter mile away. The trail climbs steeply, crosses a creek, and heads left. Here it becomes a bit fainter and harder to tell where the true trail is. Refer to your map to determine which is the best route.One-tenth of a mile past the creek crossing, emerge from the forest onto the rocky promontory called Oyster Dome. Arrayed before you are the Skagit River flats and Anacortes to the left. Lummi Island and Orcas Island are in the foreground and background, respectively, to the right. Samish Bay is below you, and in the distance are Vancouver Island and the Olympic Mountains. Birds of prey, including bald eagles, may circle above you. A word of caution: be careful near the edge of the promontory, as the dropoff is unforgiving; keep children and pets away from the edge. NOTE: There is another way to access Oyster Dome, found along Chuckanut Drive (Highway 11). This access point includes more switchbacks and elevation gain, but lacks any facilities, and requires crossing a highway to get to the trailhead. If you choose to start here, park carefully. It is a state highway, so parked cars must be completely clear of the way of travel. Any vehicles on or near the white lines delineating the shoulder of the road will be towed.","driving_directions":"Access Oyster Dome from the Samish Overlook parking area.

Entry is free, and official hours are daily 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Discovery Park Loop Trail is a designated National Recreation Trail, 2.8 miles long with an elevation change of just 140 feet. It passes through both forest and open meadows, offers extensive views, good prospects for bird watchers, and can be hiked or jogged year-round.Before there was a park here, this area was Fort Lawton and it is thanks to the fort that this large park is available to Seattlites who wish to explore an urban trail. More information on the history of the park follows the trail description.Begin your Loop Trail hike near the Visitor Center, reached from W Government Way. The center is open Tuesday through Sunday most weeks, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. (closed holidays.) It offers some environmental displays, indoor restrooms, an information desk and trail maps. Find your trailhead next to a signboard at the north end of the parking lot. The board has a park map, and often has paper copies of the trail map available for the taking. Trail maps can also be downloaded: see the Maps and Guidebooks section of this entry for the link. Two additional trailheads are mentioned below. Since this is a loop hike, they could be considered as alternative starting points. For more details, see the Driving Directions. From the signboard, head north on the trail, first going down a few steps, then hiking gently uphill for 100 yards to reach the Loop Trail. You can hike the Loop in either direction, although many think views are better if you begin by going left here. Climb a very short steep section, then level out and drop a bit. Cross a paved road--one of many dating from the military era, now used only by park vehicles. Climb some more. Here, and in all forested areas of the park, be alert for the tapping sounds of woodpeckers, including the large pileated woodpeckers sometimes seen in the park.For the next quarter mile the trail heads generally south, eventually leveling out and bending around to the west. Along the way, in late winter, you might see the white blossoms of Indian plum, a scraggly shrub that is the first to blossom each year. In the spring, you might see the bright yellow blossoms of Oregon grape or the red blooms of wild currant. Later bloomers are the native salmonberry and thimble berry.Here, and in other forested areas along the Loop Tail, tall trees sometimes fall during wind storms. You may notice a few large trunks of trees that have met that end. In 2005, a large maple tree in the park was struck by lightning and literally exploded. So dynamic events do happen here, although hopefully not during your hike.Pass by the South Parking Lot, an alternative access point for the Loop Trail, reached from W Emerson Street. Then continue on west next to the access road and soon reach the highest point on the Loop Trail. A sign points right toward a viewpoint near the old chapel that looks out over the South Meadow. You can check it out if you like. Then return to the Loop Trail, drop a bit, cross a park road and approach the meadow.In winter, you may be lucky to see a rare arctic snowy owl near this end of the meadow. In summer or fall, scan the trees to the north of the meadow for red-tail or Cooper's hawks.While great blue herons generally hunt for fish in the shallows near the shore, when fishing is not good a heron may fly up to the meadow to hunt mice. If you see a heron standing completely still in the tall grass, it's waiting for lunch.Bald eagles also prefer fish, so they usually cruise along the shore or perch high in a tree overlooking the water. But their flight paths sometimes are visible from the Loop Trail so as you cross the meadow, be alert for eagle sightings.The trail continues near the southern edge of the meadow where a short side trail leads left to a restroom facility. The views along the trail improve with every step, with the Olympic Mountains visible in the distance across Puget Sound. To the north of the meadow, a large radar dome is visible. It's an FAA radar that tracks commercial flights.You'll approach a sandy area. It's not a desert, but sand does accumulate there, blown up over the bluff by prevailing winds. Loop around the north edge of the sand dune and, in summer, note the large stand of fireweed blooming just off the trail.Before you reach the next trees, a bench offers a great view toward the south end of Puget Sound, with parts of Magnolia and West Seattle visible. If clouds permit, you may see Mount Rainier in the distance.Hike a short way beneath the trees and come to a headland that offers some of the best views in the park. Take a few minutes to appreciate it all. But take note: the bluff here is unstable and slides do occur, so it's best not to approach the edge too closely.As you leave the viewpoint, a side trail heads off to the left and leads a half-mile down to South Beach and the West Point Lighthouse. Continue on the Loop Trail, now heading north. Soon the trail forks. The left fork is the official Loop Trail. The right fork follows a metal fence and soon reconnects with the Loop Trail. Unless you have a fondness for hiking next to fences, take the left fork.Come to Discovery Park Boulevard, a road that provides access to the West Point Sewage Treatment Plant. Appropriately, a portable toilet generally sits beside the Loop Trail just before you come to the road crossing. Cross the road, continue following the trail next to the road, then head down through a forested area to reach the much smaller North Meadow. Here, the Hidden Valley Trail heads off to the left and provides another route to the beach. Climb a bit on the Loop Trail, and cross two paved old roads. The second one is shown on the trail map as Kansas Avenue.Beyond Kansas Avenue, the Loop Trail winds through two heavily forested canyons. In some years, barred owls are seen here and along the next half-mile of the trail. The owls generally are not active during the day, and if seen at all they will be dozing part way up a tree. An exception is during nesting season, when the owls can become aggressive. Sometimes hikers or joggers are buzzed by an owl, or may even be rapped on the scalp by a talon. The owls seem particularly troubled by any person sporting a ponytail or headphones.Continue on the Loop Trail. Along the way, a side trail heads downhill to the left to reach the North Parking Lot, another access point for this hike. Farther along, come to Illinois Avenue, where a second trail also heads downhill to the North Parking Lot. Cross Illinois Avenue with caution. It's a public road between the Visitor Center and the North Parking Lot. The crossing is well-marked, but not all drivers are alert for hikers.Along the next part of the Loop Trail, you might catch a view of Mount Baker off to the north.A quarter mile farther along, a veteran's cemetery is visible though the trees. Soon, the Loop Trail passes though a tunnel under W Government Way and you will and find yourself back at the trail junction where you began the Loop Trail. The parking lot and Visitor Center are just a short stroll away.With luck, you will have had some interesting bird sightings on your hike. The Seattle Audubon Society lists 270 species sometimes seen in the park, or just offshore.While birds are abundant here, you may not have seen any wild critters larger than a squirrel. There are raccoons in the park, but they are mostly nocturnal, like the smaller resident mountain beavers, so they are not often seen. But occasionally larger fauna have found their way to Discovery Park, perhaps by following the railroad tracks. In early 2008, a coyote was a park resident for several weeks. In May 2009, a black bear was spotted at least passing through the park, if not actually residing there. In September 2009, reports of a mountain lion sighting in the park were greeted with skepticism. But they persisted, and soon a lion was tracked, treed, tranquilized and transported, we hope to a happier habitat. So you never know. When you hike the Loop Trail bring your camera and be alert for surprises. Enjoy whatever you do see.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE AREAIn 1898, the War Department wanted an army base in the Puget Sound area to protect against any future naval invasion. It had been less than 40 years since US and British forces almost clashed over a disputed border in the San Juan Islands. Fortunately, that 1859 conflict was quickly defused. Only a single shot was fired and that was by a civilian. The only casualty was a pig.While the military had their own motivations, local communities saw a large military base as an opportunity for economic gain. Also, it was hoped in some quarters that the army might be enlisted to help in the event of civil unrest. Labor disputes, in particular, were common in that era. Though there was considerable rivalry between Seattle and Tacoma to see which city would host the army base, Seattle won. The city had to offer the land to the military for free, after buying out a few landowners who already owned plots there.The fort opened in 1900, and was named in honor of Major General Henry Lawton, a recent casualty of the Philippine-American conflict who had fought in earlier wars and in 1886 had played a prominent role in the capture of Apache Chief Geronimo. Fort Lawton never became the major army post local boosters hoped for. The garrison remained small, and it languished even more as time went on. At the height of the great depression, in 1938, the Army offered to sell Fort Lawton back to Seattle for only one dollar. The city declined, citing concerns about potential maintenance costs.During the Second World War, Fort Lawton was revived as an embarkation point for thousands of soldiers and tons of material headed to the South Pacific or to the Aleutians. Also, the Fort hosted a prisoner-of-war camp that held over 1000 German prisoners. During the Korean War of 1950-53, the Fort enjoyed another bustle of activity.In the 1950s, Nike anti-aircraft missile batteries were installed at Fort Lawton, and elsewhere in the Puget Sound area. A hardened missile control center that coordinated all the local batteries was located at the Fort. But within a few years those weapons were obsolete. Later, Fort Lawton was proposed as a launch site for inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs,) but that plan never materialized. In 1973, much of Fort Lawton was returned to the city of Seattle to become Discovery Park, although the Army Reserve did maintain a presence there until 2012. It was the long army tenure that eventually made the park possible, since the area otherwise would likely have become suburban housing.","driving_directions":"From 15th Ave W, just south of the Ballard Bridge, head west on W Emerson Place.

Go in the spring when the tread is snow-free and the waterfall is flowing at full volume. But keep in mind, with limited parking at the trailhead, this trailhead can get crowded.The hike starts from a trailhead at the school bus turn-around off SE Mt. Si Road--be sure not to block this turnaround if you're hiking this trail during the week! Also note that the tread consists of loose rock in places, so sturdy shoes or boots will help keep your ankles and feet happy on this hike. If you are hiking with children, keep them close by as there are some steep drop-offs along the trail. Walk around the gate and follow the gently inclining Mount Teneriffe Road for approximately two miles, to an intersection signed for Teneriffe Falls. This is the start of the new trail to the falls. Turn right at this junction and begin climbing. For hikers familiar with the old bootleg trail that was painfully steep and dangerously slippery, the new switchbacked trail is a delight! If you’re looking for a workout, don’t worry, you’ll still get it. Over the next mile, you’ll gain most of the elevation on this hike, approximately 770 vertical feet. Thanks to the work of the Department of Natural Resources and the Mountains-to-Sound Greenway, the new trail makes the effort enjoyable.The 22 switchbacks up to the base of the falls wind in and out of tree cover. Enjoy the second- and third-growth forest you’re walking through and the sounds and sights of the nearby stream flowing from Teneriffe Falls. You might glimpse sections of the old bootleg trail that ran parallel to the stream along the way. Though it may be tempting to explore, please stick to the new trail! It was built to provide a safer route for hikers and to minimize erosion and sediment in the fish-bearing stream. As you near the end of the trail, you’ll get a view of the lower part of Teneriffe Falls. Snap a photo, and then continue up the last couple switchbacks to a viewpoint for the upper falls. You’ll reach this point (unsigned) approximately three miles from the trailhead and 2370 feet in elevation. Due to funding issues, this last section has not been brought up to standards. As a result, DNR does not consider the trail complete. The viewing area is a small, mostly flat area with a steep downhill drop-off, so be careful where you step and where you set your pack. If you choose to scramble down to the level area between the upper and lower falls, be aware of slippery rocks and sketchy hand and foot holds. Both make it difficult to get down and then back up to the trail safely. For groups of three people or fewer, this makes a nice snack or lunch spot. Larger groups should choose a spot down trail to take a break.WTA Pro Tip: If you're interested in extending your hike, it's possible to do so! Return to the junction with the road-to-trail conversion and continue heading up and up. After 2.25 miles of hiking, you'll come to a fork in the trail. The left branch is a trail that accesses the summit of Mount Si, just about 1 mile away. Alternatively, you can stick to the road-to-trail and in another 2.5 miles you'll arrive at the summit of Mount Teneriffe. Hiking all the way to the summit of Teneriffe makes for a 13.8 mile roundtrip hike.","driving_directions":"From I-90, take exit 32 (436th Avenue SE).

The entry for the OLD trail can be found here: www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mailbox-peak-old-trail/The old trail up Mailbox Peak was the stuff of legend. It inspired potential Rainier climbers, challenged adventurous day hikers, and occasionally Mother Nature used the trail to bite back. The number of injuries and rescues on the old trail, as well as terrible erosion caused by the masses of daily visitors, prompted the Department of Natural Resources to create a new trail to the top. While still relatively steep, this new route, built in part by WTA volunteers, offers a safer way for folks to attain the summit of this formidable peak. Your trip begins along the Middle Fork Road. The hike is wildly popular--on a typical weekend, the trailhead can have upward of 50 cars at any given hour. The new trail also came with a new upper parking lot, but even so, don't expect to get a spot in the parking lot unless you arrive very early. Hang your Discover Pass in your car and head out, walking for a short jaunt along a paved DNR road. Approach a gate and slip around it. About one hundred yards past the gate, an inviting opening indicates the location of the new trail. Set out for the summit here, along a trail that switchbacks along the northwest face of Mailbox Peak. Bridges and creek crossings await you in the lower section of the hike, and then the switchbacks start. At roughly 850 of elevation gain per mile, your thighs will feel the burn once you start climbing, and it won't let up until you're standing triumphantly next to the Mailbox. Distract yourself by taking a look at the construction of the trail. A multitude of WTA volunteer crews worked to create rock fords and turnpikes (elevated sections of trail) that keep your feet dry as you cross many creeks. The switchbacks continue for about 4 miles, before rejoining the old trail at elevation 3860 feet for your final push to the summit. This last push consists of 960 feet of elevation gain in half a mile--hopefully the approach warmed you up for the final assault! If your energy flags, remember what views await you at the summit. The peak's position at the end of a long ridgeline means you'll have an even better vantage point for panoramas than you might on other summits like Granite or Bandera. Rainier is in your face, and to the northwest, the Middle Fork Valley stretches before you like a lush green carpet. If nothing else, think about what might be in the mailbox itself besides the summit register. Folks have found beer, toys, even a fire hydrant at the top! What might you find?

At this point it seems amazing to think you will be up there by the end of your hike, but a look at a trail map will reveal some well-engineered switchbacks -- courtesy of many WTA work parties -- that will get you to your destination with less effort than you might expect. The old trail to the summit was in bad shape from heavy use and no maintenance, but WTA work parties helped create this beautiful avenue through second-growth forest to the rocky ledges. In addition to adding a half mile to the old trail, the steepness was lessened a bit.From the parking lot, head to a gate on the southeast side of the lake and follow a short service road about a quarter-mile to the trailhead.

Stay low and to the left to get the big view of the falls, then climb the stairs along the water for a more personal and often soaking visit. Exercise caution near the water, especially with children. The creek can sweep hikers off their feet and down the hill.Back on the main trail to Serene Lake the route crosses the creek then begins the final climb. It's a steady ascent using stairs, roots, and rocks for the final 1.5 miles gaining 1,300 feet.Keep your eyes open for patches of bunchberry and other shade-loving flowers, especially as you leave the dense forest for the sun-dappled traverse to the ridge.Once the trail crosses into the basin it's hard not to run down the hill to the lake, but stick to the trail. In an area as popular as Lake Serene it's important to practice the principles of Leave No Trace and good wilderness etiquette. Across the water the cliffs of Mt. Index rise 3,000 feet straight up and snow is piled at the base after a winter full of avalanches.Follow the trail along the shore to a huge rock perfect for a seat while you contemplate the serenity of nature.The Lake Serene trail is immensely popular resulting in scarce parking on nice days. Arrive early to miss the crowds on the way up, but practice good trail etiquette and yield to climbers as you descend.WTA Pro Tip: Round trip to Lake Serene only is 7.2 miles. If you decide to include the detour to Bridal Veil Falls, do so on the way to the lake. Don't save it for the return as it's too easy to skip the steep climb when the trailhead is so close.","driving_directions":"From Everett, follow US 2 east to the small town of Gold Bar.

This easy-access day hike delivers comparable—if not superior—panoramic views and lung-busting switchbacks to Mount Si, with significantly less foot traffic. Start by following the signs for John Wayne Trail and Twin Falls at the south end of the parking lot near the bathroom structure. This short spur trail climbs immediately south then west before merging with a gravel logging road in a few hundred yards. Stay right at the junction, continuing to climb uphill for another tenth of a mile, and stay right at the next junction with the John Wayne Pioneer Trail/Iron Horse Trail—another wide gravel logging road. In just a few hundred feet, head south on the second trail into the forest, 0.3 miles from the trailhead, marked by a small rock cairn. This is the start of the Mount Washington Trail.The trail climbs steeply to the southwest before easing to a moderate grade over rocky terrain and crossing several small creeks. While mostly switch-backing through an old growth forest of pines and sheer rock faces, the trail opens for occasional views to the North, revealing just how quickly it’s ascended from the parking lot.  Less than a mile from the trailhead, hikers pass the base of a small cave-turned-climbing wall, with several anchors speckling the inverted hang of its upper reaches. Continue climbing and veer right on the main path when the trail reaches its first official marker—a hand-carved wooden sign that reads “MT WA.” About 1.6 miles from the trailhead, a small clearing oft referred to as “Owl Hike Spot” offers the first westward views, allowing a brief photo-op of Rattlesnake Ledge. Previous trail guides often stopped at this point, but superior views are enjoyed farther along. Continue climbing and stay right at the junction with the Great Wall Trail at two miles, revealing the first views of the summit. The trail eases, exiting the dense cover of forest as it approaches a small marsh and turns sharply east toward another unmarked trail junction. Again, stay left, following the main path east as it navigates long switchbacks and bursts into an alpine meadow decorated with scree slopes, boulders and spring wildflowers at about the three mile mark.You'll soon arrive at a sharp switchback. At the curve of the switchback you're right on the boundary between public land and the Cedar River Watershed, the water supply for the city of Seattle. Signs along this section of trail ask you to respect the watershed, so be sure to stay on the trail here and practice Leave No Trace as you round a southwest-facing slope and make the final push to the summit of Mount Washington. From the top, take in views of the peaks surrounding you, but be sure to look down at Chester Morse Lake and Masonry Pool. It's amazing to realize that these two lakes are what help keep the megalopolis of Puget Sound hydrated.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 38.

A nearly-1000-feet-of-elevation-gain-per-mile price. But views of pointed Kaleetan Peak, deep blue Crystal Lake, the climber-dotted Tooth, and Mount Rainier dominating the skyline to the south make it all worth it. Begin at the Pratt Lake trailhead in cool, mossy forest, where you hike along a wide, moderately-graded tread. On the way to the junction for Granite Mountain Trail, a large switchback offers views straight up a steep, debris-filled avalanche chute. This is evidence of a real danger in the winter and early spring; hikers without avalanche gear are better off waiting until the snow has melted down before tackling Granite. After 1.2 miles, arrive at the junction. Here the Pratt Lake trail continues on a moderate grade via the left fork, but your vertical adventure is just beginning. Granite Mountain Trail heads off to the right.After the junction, the trail narrows and becomes rockier, so watch your step as you continue hiking through quiet forest. While it may be shady, it's unlikely you'll be chilly. The steep grade will keep you warm as you follow narrow switchbacks up, up, up. Just under a mile from the junction, cross the avalanche chute you peered up near the beginning of the trail. A seasonal stream runs down the chute and early in the season you can replenish your water supply from it, but don't forget to filter! Continue past the chute and traverse eastward, up onto the shoulder of Granite Mountain. When you break into high meadows, the steep grade lessens. Catch your breath and scan the horizon. How many of the summits can you identify? After orienting yourself, press on. The trail becomes increasingly rock-laden, slowing your pace as you clamber up and around large boulders. It's here that you realize just how appropriate Granite Mountain's name is. Fortunately, the views are gorgeous and huckleberry bushes line the trail. In late summer, the berries provide a rejuvenating snack. A switchback in the trail reveals the lookout that is your destination, but don't be fooled. From your first sighting of the structure it's still a mile to the summit. The trail progresses north, with the lookout on your left. Leave the fields of huckleberries and follow the narrow, rocky trail through the bottom of a basin. Enjoy the easiest part of this hike, a jaunt through a green alpine meadow bordered by a talus slope to the south. The final push is a grunt, but the views! Break out above treeline onto a talus field, and marvel at the lookout perched on the rocks. Further afield, Mount Stuart and the Teanaway are visible to the east, Rainier commands your view to the south, and if it's a clear day, you can make out Baker floating on the northern horizon. WTA Pro Tip: The Granite Mountain Lookout can accommodate a relatively small number of people. During the summer and especially on weekends, Granite Mountain can have as many as 100 hikers at its summit, so please be courteous to fellow hikers and limit your time spent exploring the lookout if there is a ranger at the summit who has opened it to the public.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 47.

Most would describe it as an easy hike--relatively short and not very steep for most of its length–-but then it suddenly changes, turning informal and rough, particularly in its last half mile, making it feel like the rugged backcountry trek it at times can be. Start out on the Ira Spring Trail. The parking lot will likely be full if you come here on a nice weekend day. Not only is Bandera a popular hike, but it shares a trailhead with the equally popular trails to Mason Lake and Mount Defiance. For the first mile and a half, it is gentle and wide as it follows an old road bed (about halfway through this first section, a water crossing may be somewhat difficult during times of heavy runoff). Luckily, thanks to the efforts of volunteer crews and the generosity of the Spring Trust for Trails, a sturdy footbridge has been installed across the creek, and hikers can safely cross it in all seasons. Past the bridge, the trail departs the old road and heads more steeply uphill. Occasional breaks in the trees enable partial views of Rainier to the south. In another mile and a quarter, after a series of looping switchbacks, the trail to Bandera and the trail to Mason Lake part company as the way to Bandera heads straight uphill through a meadow of beargrass and bleached stumps of trees burned in a fire long ago. The next fifth of a mile is steep –- in fact, one of the steepest stretches of trail you’ll find, gaining one foot of elevation for every two feet it travels. The saving grace for those not used to this sort of climbing is that it is mercifully brief and boasts firm footing in the form of numerous rocks and boulders. The trail soon reaches a ridge and heads east along it. At times, it becomes somewhat difficult to follow as it enters minor rock fields, until reaching Little Bandera, technically a false summit. The vast majority of people turn around here after pausing to picnic among the blocky granite and stunted firs. There is nothing false about the views-–this spot provides an excellent vantage of the ridge and meadows to the south, as well as across I-90 to nearby peaks like McClellan Butte and the ubiquitous Rainier. Turning around here gives you a round trip hike of 7 miles, with about 2850 feet of elevation gain; perfectly respectable for a day hike. If you must press on to the true summit, know that the trail gets hard to follow. It drops steeply over the rocks of Little Bandera’s summit and is barely visible. You'll lose and then regain elevation as you follow the ridge. Few people venture out this way–-Bandera Mountain's actual summit is forested and holds no real attraction save for the glory of reaching a summit less than 100 feet taller than the false summit you just stood on.","driving_directions":"Take exit 45 off of I-90 and turn north onto FR 9030.

Be aware that weekend parking could pose a challenge at the Little Si trailhead, but there will be nothing little about your hiking experience.Start your ascent on the Little Si trail. After 0.3 miles you will come to a junction with the Boulder Garden Loop. If you prefer a counterclockwise loop, make a right turn and briefly descend, then ascend a moderately steep grade past building-sized, moss-adorned rock behemoths and reach the junction with the Old Mount Si trail 1.2 miles later. If you are eager to summit sooner, continue 0.2 miles from the first junction to the second junction with the Boulder Garden Loop and make a right turn, reaching the Old Mount Si junction at in 0.6 more miles. Either way, as you hike, enjoy the recovering Douglas fir and western hemlock forest that dominates in the loop area and at lower elevations on Si.The Old Mount Si trail takes off up and to the right at a signpost that does not indicate the destination of the ascending trail; it's signed for the directions of the Boulder Garden Loop trail. However, as you leave the loop, the elevation gain leaves no uncertainty that you are headed in the correct direction--up. Hike carefully in snow, because the trail is steep and tends to be icy. Traction devices like crampons are highly recommended. Ascend 2.4 steep miles at a grade of 1000 feet per mile, switchbacking up the mountain through mountain hemlock and ultimately fir forest. You will come close to the new trail on a hairpin near the end of this segment, but keep left to avoid the crowds. You will reach the junction with the new trail along a turnpike segment. Take careful note of this unmarked junction-—it's important for your return trip. If you miss it, you'll to return to the wrong parking lot! Join the new trail here, and head up some more. Soon the haystack will hove into view. The basin and the haystack at the top of Si, along with panoramic views of West Defiance Ridge, the Snoqualmie Valley, and Puget Sound are only 0.2 miles away.

Although relatively steep inclines bookend this hike, this primarily north to south route is perfect for beginners who are looking to get back in shape. But with opportunities to cut away on the Boulder Garden Loop at 0.3 miles and 0.5 miles to merge with the more challenging Mount Si trail, it also accommodates veteran hikers. Expect crowds; the two Si peaks are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"Resolution Peaks\" due to the onslaught of hikers that appear after January 1st. The trail's proximity to the city and a degree of refuge from the elements often divert heavy foot traffic to this mini-mountain, keeping it busy year round.A sharp incline awaits you as you depart the trailhead, threading you through a few winding switchbacks and well-beaten paths, but do not despair! The hike eventually levels out to reward you with some respite from the calf-burning first quarter mile. Two opportunities to get on the Boulder Garden Loop will occur at 0.3 and 0.5 miles, both of which can tack on extra mileage to the trip or transition you to the Mount Si route if you so desire, but for the Little Si summit proceed left on the main trail until you reach a section of canopied forest that straddles the bluff. As you continue through this temperate slice of woodlands, you will pass short tangential rock climbing paths, a prominent scree slope and a boulder field to the west before swooping around the slope at the 1.3 mile mark to make your final push toward the summit. Work your way up the last steep three quarters of a mile and you will reach your destination. While Little Si’s nub-like qualities suggest an underwhelming view awaits, you will be pleasantly surprised to find a peak that supplies phenomenal portraits of the valley and the surrounding peaks-Mount Si and Mount Washington can easily be viewed on a clear day-from your standing elevation of 1,550 feet. WTA Pro Tip: Very early on at 0.2 miles, make sure to duck off the trail to the southwest for a small ridge that provides a quick peek into the valley, a low elevation preview of what you can expect from the summit. If you’re short on time or are not quite in the shape you thought you were when you started in the parking lot, it can function as a nice compromise for a picnic spot to watch the sunset on the valley. Also, once you feel you have mastered the Little Si trail, seek out other North Bend staples such as Rattlesnake Ridge, Mount Si and Mailbox Peak (all located within a five mile drive of the Little Si trailhead).

The trail begins in a gravel parking lot just after entering the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest from the west. It's actually more like a glorified shoulder off Highway 2. The trailhead is located on the west side of the parking area. An information kiosk is located about 20 feet up the trail from the parking area, but there are no facilities, so make your pit stop prior to arrival.Once on the trail, head east, paralleling the highway for a short time before turning left and heading away from the road. Remember that it's only a 1.3-mile hike to the lookout, so feel free to take your time; you'll be gazing up at the massive building soon enough. As you walk through the woods, enjoy the greens of the ferns and moss. Listen to the birds signing and keep an eye out for squirrels and chipmunks scurrying about. Appreciate and note the well-maintained trail, worked on as recently as 2013 by WTA trail crews.The trail is a tranquil walk in the woods until right before you reach the lookout where you are presented a view of the mountains on the other side of the highway.

With just a bit more elevation gain, and slightly more rugged terrain, it's the perfect place to take children on their first ‘real’ hike. The trail is short, but steep and challenging--it'll give a child a real sense of accomplishment once they reach the lake.. The lake itself is a scenic little lake located on the northeastern slope of Mount Pilchuck. The trail takes off just left of the large parking lot, and immediately begins to climb through old second growth forest on a series of switchbacks. As you climb through the woods, note the huge rotting stumps with the springboard notches on the side. Springboards were boards placed in tree trunks for the loggers of yore to stand on as they used a large crosscut saw to take down the tree. Notice young trees growing out of the stumps--old stumps nursing new forest. The trail reaches an old logging road, and follows it for a short distance before it begins to climb again. At this point the trail becomes very rocky and rooty and in high runoff, wet, with little streamlets running through the rocks. Watch for little waterfalls along the way. The vegetation becomes more interesting as the trail climbs. Admire from the trail the large prickly leaves and bright red berries of devils club and fern understory. You will reach a clearing in the woods as the trail takes a slight bend. After crossing the clearing, look for the wide, spreading roots of a long ago downed tree on your right. The soil has since been packed hard here by many small feet (and some big ones) posing for pictures. As you continue to climb through the forest again, notice the big old-growth trees that escaped the saws of days past. Give them a hug, then cross another small clearing, and soon the trail begins to level out. Only another quarter of a mile to go and you will be at the lake. The ground is marshy and the trail muddy, but there is a nice boardwalk across some of this. In spring the marsh will be bright yellow with the large showy flowers of skunk cabbage. You will glimpse the lake, but just before you reach it, there is a fork in the trail. The trail goes all around the lake so it really doesn’t matter which direction you choose, you will only add a little over half a mile. The right fork crosses a series of boardwalks through the woods, and then on to some fine lunch rocks on the far side of the lake. The trail left follows the shore past some nice camp spots along the water. On the east side of the lake there is an open marshy area. You will find a succession of wildflowers here, starting with the marsh marigolds and trillium and ending with fall asters. Notice the contorted mountain hemlock along this section of the trail, and speculate on what caused it to grow that way. There is also more boardwalk here that passes by a quiet little pond with some reflection picture opportunities, and nice views of Mount Pilchuck. On your way back, as you pass the outlet stream, notice all the berry bushes and make a note to revisit this little gem of a lake in the fall!  Pro Tip: This is a very popular hike on sunny weekends. Visit midweek, pack breakfast and a thermos of coffee, get there before nine, and have the lake to yourself.","driving_directions":"From I-5 in Everett, take Exit 194/Snohomish Wenatchee, then take Exit 204/Lake Stevens.

Be sure to have your coat with you!The Gingko Petrified Forest Interpretive Trails offer a trip through time, back to when lava flowing across Washington encased the trees. Gradually, the minerals in the lava replaced the organic matter of the trees. What remains are fascinating specimens of mineralized gingkos, spruce, elm, walnut, and fir trees – a remarkably diverse representation of Washington’s state gemstone. A quarter-mile long paved loop trail makes most of the tree specimens accessible for all visitors. Those wishing to explore further can go off the paved path, onto a longer, gravel-and-dirt loop that edges the state park’s property line. Along with the venerable tree specimens, huge sagebrush dot the landscape, some towering over your head as you wend in and out of the petrified trees. Taking a full tour of the area is about a 3-mile jaunt -- just enough time for many visitors to get a good stretch in. One thing of note: because of previous visitors removing pieces of the ancient trees as keepsakes, the remaining trees have been protected by the state park. Please don’t attempt to touch these specimens, or remove any you may find in your wanderings. As tempting as it may be to take a little piece of nature home, the Interpretive Trails must have intact examples for future generations to appreciate these natural marvels.","driving_directions":"Drive east on Interstate 90 to exit 136 for Huntzinger Road.

And unlike many trails, which sacrifice peripheral scenery on the journey for the prospect of a grand summit view, the Woody Trail is consistently gorgeous as you wind your way along the Wallace River and approach the nine dazzling falls.  The moderate elevation gain (1300 feet, most of which occurs on a series of switchbacks between the Middle and Upper Falls) might give beginners cause to worry, but you can take comfort in the knowledge that there are still great views to be had at the more accessible Lower and Middle Falls stops. The Middle Falls overlook provides arguably the trail’s most impressive scenery with a panoramic view of the Skykomish River valley and the distant portrait of the Olympic Mountains trailing into the horizon.Wallace Falls (deriving its name from Kwayaylsh, surname of the first homesteaders in the area) trail is in great condition. Although the park sees a lot of foot traffic due to its popularity, the trail remains well maintained and relatively clean thanks in part to maintenance from WTA, who has had work parties attend to this trail over the last four years. There are some sections, especially pushing on from the Middle Falls to Upper Falls, where the way becomes more rugged, but these sections are brief. To begin, find the trailhead just off the parking lot, framed by the information kiosk and the restroom facilities. Trek under a pair of mammoth power lines, which despite doing their level best to ruin potential photo ops of Mount Index and Baring Mountain at the clearing, do not completely remove the grandeur of the view. Continue left, trading the last traces of civilization for the gentle babbling of the Wallace River as you duck under a canopy of aged hemlocks. At the half-mile marker, you will encounter a split in the trail. The path on the right, distinguished by a wooden gate (intended to signal that the trail is hiker-only from here on out), leads to the Woody Trail. The left fork diverts to the old Railroad Grade, a longer bike-accessible path. Bikers and more seasoned visitors may swing left to experience the further delights of the park, including paths that lead north to Lake Wallace, but proceed through the gate on the right to the Woody Trail if you are on foot and desire the compact Wallace Falls experience.From there, trace the Wallace River where you may catch fly fishermen playing hooky from work or any number of introspective visitors enjoying the many benches and natural nooks that the trail provides. Eventually you will break from the river and encounter the trail’s first steep climb. Continue up, encountering diversionary paths for the Amphitheater and the Railroad Grade trail, but stay on the Woody Trail until you reach the Picnic area at the Lower Falls, just two miles from the trailhead. Stop to admire the falls, but push less than half a mile for the prospects of better views at the Middle Falls, which boast the most impressive panoramic sights on the trail. There is no shame calling it a day at the Middle Falls overlook, but the hardcore, spry, or those with something to prove will power up the steepest grade of the trail, a sweat inducing half-mile of switchbacks that lead to the Upper Falls, where the path officially concludes at 2.8 miles.WTA Pro-Tip: Often known for the nine waterfalls, Wallace Falls State Park and the surrounding parks are less well-known for mountain biking, fishing, swimming, boating, kayaking and rock climbing opportunities. Visitors looking to participate in any of the ancillary activities offered should contact the park and inquire into the seasonal availability of these experiences.Dogs are allowed at Wallace Falls, but are required to be leashed at all times. There is a strictly enforced fine for unleashed dogs stemming from a number of incidents where unleashed dogs have been swept over the falls. Please be mindful of the dangers of the park for the safety of you and your pet.","driving_directions":"Proceeding from Everett on Hwy 2, approach the city of Gold Bar. Turn left onto 1st Street, then drive .4 miles and take a right onto May Creek Rd (there will be Wallace Falls signage for both turns).

Right will take you into Camp Huston, so proceed left and drive up a short path into the Wallace Falls State Park parking lot. The lot is spacious, but can easily fill up on the weekends as the park is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. Please do not park along the road that accesses the parking area for Wallace Falls State Park. There are bathroom facilities just off the parking lot and also on the trail (just a quick .2 mile detour at the 1.5 mile marker on the Woody trail). The hours of operation for the park are 8 a.m.-dusk. The information kiosk should have a clock clearing labeling sunset as reference for hikers heading out.

For most of its course, the trail follows the path of Barclay Creek, which is tucked into a narrow valley between Gunn and Merchant Peaks to the north and Baring Mountain to the south. Because this trail is popular (consider going on a weekday to avoid the crowds), and the area receives 150-200 inches of precipitation each year, WTA has performed trail maintenance to build turnpikes and drainage structures to ensure a passable route. Nevertheless, you may encounter muddy or watery spots along the way. Barclay Lake was not included in the Wild Sky Wilderness because of its historical use by groups larger than those permitted in wilderness areas. This makes it a great destination for Boy Scout troops, extended families, and other large outdoor outings.The trail gains a net 200 feet of elevation over its course to the lake, though there is enough up-and-down to keep you from getting bored. You will see Douglas firs, western hemlocks, and red cedars, some of which are surviving old-growth specimens. Watch for mushroom species, maidenhair ferns, queen’s cup, trillium, salmonberry, and bunchberry. If you look up, you will catch peek-a-boo vistas of the mountains to the north.At the 1.2-mile mark, cross over Barclay Creek on a log bridge with a single railing. Use caution, as the bridge may be slippery. Continue 0.5 miles and reach Barclay Lake’s north shore. Baring Mountain’s precipitous and rocky northern face suddenly dominates the view. Take in the reflections of evergreens, sky, and Baring in the lake’s peaceful waters. Depending on the time of day, you are likely to encounter campers or fishermen, or perhaps even be one of them!

Covering 1,463 acres of forest, ponds and meadows, the area is named for homesteader Mitchell Lord who farmed the area in the late 1880s. Hikers can roam all day on the network of trails leading through the forest, down to the Snohomish River and up to views of the Cascades and Snohomish valley. Explore, and keep an eye out for the wildlife that live in these woods.There are hundreds of possible adventures at Lord Hill. Try the loop described below for a full day of exploration. If that's too much, try the short Beaver Lake Loop which follows Beaver Lake to the Pipeline Trail, then to the Main trail and back to the parking lot. A longer option is the trail that borders the Snohomish River. Whatever you choose, be sure to have a map with you as you plan your route. The many wanderings to be had here start off as you leave the parking lot on the boardwalk trail. Head either left on the Main trail or right on the Beaver Lake trail, either way is good. The Main trail will lead to the junction with the West View trail. Follow that, and it will lead to a nice loop and a viewpoint on Devils Butte, with nice views looking north across the valley to the mountains. The Beaver Lake trail heads down to hit the Pipeline trail, the most direct north-south route. This description will follow the Pipeline, taking you by several ponds, old quarry sites, and eventually to the Snohomish River. Once you reach the intersection with the Beaver Lake and Pipeline trails, take the side trail down to Beaver Lake. Here the lake is filling in with grass and becoming more like a marsh. You can continue along a trail around Beaver Lake, but as of this writing, this trail is not on any maps. If you don’t feel comfortable just poking around without direction, stay on the Pipeline trail, which meets up with the Temple Pond loop trail. Are you in an exploring mood? Take the route around the east side of the lake, skirting the park boundary above the lake in a wooded area. Keep following the trail through the woods, cross a little outlet stream and head up. You will see signs marking this the Red Barn trail, but again, it does not appear on a map. This area was logged at least twice, once of its old-growth trees, then again of the second-growth. You can still see some big stumps with springboard notches, now serving as nurse stumps for red huckleberry. Because the trees here are third-growth forest, enough light comes through for sword fern and salal to thrive. Eventually this trail comes to a 'T' junction with the Temple Pond loop. Take the left fork and head to Temple Pond, the biggest pond in the park. Reach the shores of Temple Pond after a nice stroll through the forest. The remains of old stumps, clumps of cattails and reflections of the surrounding trees are certainly photo-worthy. Try to capture a picture of a few of the resident ducks. With a little luck, you may see a beaver. Once done, finish the loop and end up back on the Pipeline trail.Once back on the Pipeline, follow it downhill, zigzag past a tiny pond where there is an intersection. If you're looking for a shorter hike, you can loop back to the trailhead here. To lengthen your hike, keep going downhill toward the Snohomish River. Here is another intersection with the Pipeline loop, which makes a loop through the woods here. Go straight down a steep little hill and hit the Quarry trail heading to the west, an unsigned intersection at this writing. This interesting trail takes you past a big grassy bowl that used to be an old quarry, past a large pond, then up and around a ledge above the pond where a nice bench awaits you and your trail snack. Keep following the trail north and it eventually hits the Main trail. The Main trail goes west, then south to the Snohomish River. Eat lunch by the river and watch for eagles above.Following the Pipeline trail to the end will bring you to the southern trailhead off of Tester Road. Follow the River View Quarry trail along an old road. Look for some old rusted equipment along this stretch of the trail. The grass is too high for good river views, but you can make your way down to the river bank from the old road. Loop back and hit the Quarry trail, then proceed to wander at will, eventually ending back at the main trailhead.

Ducks, woodpeckers, blackbirds, and songbirds are present in large numbers.Three Lakes: Back on the main trail, continue hiking, traversing muddy lowlands and crossing several creeks that often flood during periods of high rain (which is often). The tread gets rougher and rockier, heading deeper into the saturated, verdant forest. Cross a maple flat frequented by elk before beginning a steep climb high above Big Creek. The cedars are enormous along these steep slopes. Several behemoths lay toppled across the trail, victims of strong winter storms.

From here, signs may direct you to Angel Falls and Covell Creek Falls, but they'll likely simply say 'waterfall', rather than specify which one). Covel Creek is first, then Angel.In the half-mile from the intersection to Covel Creek Falls, the trail skirts basalt cliffs of towering more than 200 feet above the trail. Occasionally these outcroppings overhang the trail, and brushes of ferns and mosses hang down above your head. Shading the trail on the downhill side is vine maple, and between the cliffs, ferns, mosses, and trees, this is a really pretty section of trail. An added bonus here is the old lava tube style caves.Covell Creek Falls is a memorable destination. Here, the trail dives behind the wall of water, or in the case of the late summer, thin fountain-like streams coming down the 75 foot basalt face. The only full trailside views of the falls are on the far side of the creek, but the vegetation around the falls is fragile, so please refrain from departing the trail for a better photo. Past Covel Creek falls, the trail climbs again, this time more steeply. The trail is typically well-maintained but rugged. That, combined with the steepness meas you'll definitely want good shoes for this hike.

This is largely open grazing land, scabbed with basalt outcroppings and mesas—and a river running through it. The ranch can be remarkably receptive or harsh, depending on the day or month. The terrain was scoured by Ice Age floods, leaving scattered lakes—Wall, Turtle, Perch—where raging floods gouged divots between basalt cliffs. Trails, if you need them, are old ranch roads, which are sometimes but not always open to motorized use.The trail to Towell Falls starts through the gate near the kiosk and heads south on an old ranch road. This road is open to motorized use roughly from April, when the ground dries, to early June, when it’s closed to prevent fires. Wildflowers peak in April and early May. Common wildlife sightings include coyotes, mule deer, and hawks. Rock Creek holds rainbow and brown trout, and some of the ranch lakes hold bass and panfish. Special Washington fishing regulations apply. Keep dogs on leash to protect them during snake season.The route parallels Rock Creek before the stream bends west and away from the road. After hiking 2.8 miles, ascend to a basalt bluff overlooking the creek and affording the first glimpse of Towell Falls in the distance. The route then drops to a small seasonal parking area.A marker leads you on a faint trail straight toward the larger lower falls. Take the faint path down toward the creek and bend to the right along a small basalt cliff, heading upstream. Skirt right onto an old road cut around a small grove of aspens, and then drop off the bluff onto the scabrock bench that leads to the creek. You can walk to the edge of the upper falls.","driving_directions":"From I-90 at Sprague, take exit 245 and head south (through town) on State Route 23 toward Saint John and Steptoe.

There are several access points in the wildlife refuge. The Headquarters area has a 2-mile trail, and Big Ditch, Wylie Slough and Fir Island are also popular walking access areas. Winter walks planned to see the gorgeous migrating snow geese, trumpeter and tundra swans are a good way for your kids to get outside. The Skagit Wildlife Area has numerous access points that allow you to walk dikes along the shore of Skagit Bay.

In winter, the falls are a snow-topped mound of ice with a flowing creek base.In mid-winter, the trip starts at the end of plowing for State Route 20, a joint parking area for skiers and snowmobiles at 2210 feet of elevation.  The first 2.1 miles are westbound on State Route 20 with the snowmobiles.  Be aware that weekends bring many snowmobiles onto this road, some moving quite fast.While trudging up the road, take in the few peek-a-boo views of Gardner Mountain and Silver Star Mountain.  At 1.5 miles, the road crosses Early Winters Creek, providing a look at the snow-covered creek.  At 2.1 miles (2670 feet), on the left is USFS Road 5310-200, marked Trailhead. This is your stop.Turn up the road, leaving most, but not all, of the snowmobiles behind.  Follow the road as it climbs through the forest, reaching the summer trailhead for Cedar Creek 3 miles from the end of plowing at 3040 feet of elevation.  Typically, the tracks of many animals, like deer, coyote, weasel, snowshoe hare and others will be evident along and crossing the road in this area.The summer trailhead facilities are usually unlocked, and the trail register is available.  The trail to the falls starts to the left of the trailhead sign.  However ,the route is not marked with signs or blazes, so understand your route and have a map -- simply following in someone's footsteps does not guarantee you'll arrive safely at your destination. Remember that it is not unusual to be breaking trail, knee deep in snow for the next 1.8 miles, which can be quite strenuous.From the trailhead sign, the trail initially goes east for about 60 yards and then turns south onto a climbing traverse, crossing a small creek bed at 3.3 miles.  At 3.4 miles the trail is on a nearly level bench suitable for winter camping.After the level bench, the trail gradually climbs on a sidehill, crossing many dry creeks.  Depending upon snow condition, the tree wells can be fairly deep and/or icy, while the open areas can be deep snow.Cedar Creek is well below the trail, and barely heard, until about 4 miles.  At 4.6 miles, the trail crosses a couple of steep slopes, one with a 100ft run-out down to the creek.The unmarked falls are reached at 4.8 miles and 3570 feet of elevation, evidenced by a shallow bench to the left (east) of the trail, also a viable campsite.The falls are only visible from the edge of the bench area.  As this area has numerous rocky cliffs, care should be taken approaching the edges to get a view of the falls, due to overhanging snow buildup.  In November, the falls have an icy fringe and by mid January, the fall are obscured by the buildup of ice clinging everything in the falls basin.Note: The snow and road conditions cause significant variability in the round trip distance & elevation gain, ranging from 3.6 miles & 530 feet elevation gain to 9.6 miles & 1360 feet elevation gain. The shortest is in November, while the summer trailhead is accessible and the trail is snow covered.  The longest is in January-March when State Route 20 is blocked by snow at milepost 178.  In December and April, when a small turnout is plowed at the junction with USFS 5310-200, the trip is 5.4 miles & 900 feet of elevation.","driving_directions":"From Winthrop take State Route 20 west for 15 miles to the plowed parking area and the road closed sign.In December, and April, the road may be plowed all the way to the gate at milepost 171.

If the turnout at USFS 5310-200 is full, another small turnout is plowed at Klipchuck Road, 0.1 miles to the west.Note: In winter, the plowing of State Route 20 from milepost 178 to milepost 171 can be discontinued without warning and not plowed again until the spring clearing in April.","distance":"9.6 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"48.5803562","longitude":"-120.48204","elevation_gain":"1350","highest_point":"3570"},{"features":["Mountain views","Dogs allowed on leash","Summits","Good for kids"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/eastern_washington.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//46.0801,-117.1685/@46.0801,-117.1685,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/puffer-butte_rlucido.jpeg/@@images/fc50ccf5-cffe-4925-9e61-db7a7d53b6e7.jpeg","region":"Eastern Washington","current_rating":"4.00 out of 5","name":"Field Springs State Park - Puffer Butte","trail_description":"Nestled in the far, far southeast corner of Washington State, Puffer Butte is a year-round favorite, and the jewel of the Fields Spring State Park -- a beautiful part of the state park system here.Puffer Butte is the high point in Fields Spring State park, where you can see incredible vistas of the Wallowa Mountains.

Learn about native animals and the role wetlands play in creating healthy habitat for the animals you will likely hear flitting about in the trees or scurrying through the brush. It's a 1.98 mile loop, but if little legs get tired you can cut out early using the Twin Creeks Trail, which bisects the loop, making it closer to a one-mile outing. Sections of the trail are boardwalk, so be careful when it's wet. Where it's not boardwalk, it is quite muddy, so in the wet season be sure to have good boots. A quarter-mile of exploring can be added if you wander along the shoreline's Sandy Beach Trail, where you might see shorebirds like teal or seagulls, and ducks like buffleheads or mallards.  Or, up the hill from the main parking area is a short interpretive trail at the ranger station. This features signs identifying red huckleberry, orange honeysuckle, thimbleberry, salmonberry, and many other plants native to the area.Note: In summer, the park is open from 8 a.m. to dusk.

The unassuming parking area for West Hylebos Wetlands is a gateway to a surprisingly rich, diverse, and lush wetland. Walk down the wide graveled path past two restored cabins, the Denny and Barker cabins. The Barker cabin is the oldest structure in Federal Way -- Barker was one of the first settlers here and he lived on these wetlands with four other settler families. Near the trailhead, the land is open and parklike. An informational kiosk greets visitors just a few hundred feet from the parking area, and the path wends around a large hedge, introducing you to a much more wooded, protected environment. Shortly after passing the kiosk, a trail to the right indicates the Marlake Loop. This is a short, muddy trail to a small lake adjacent to private property. It's a somewhat underwhelming trail; the good stuff further into the wetland, so stay to the left. Proceed down the wider trail and into the forest. Giant red cedars, hemlocks, and Douglas fir trees dripping with moss surround you, and soon the trail changes from gravel to boardwalk. In winter or rainy periods, the boardwalk can be slippery, so having good grips on your shoes or a walking stick will help here. Interpretive signs periodically inform the visitor what flora and fauna surrounds the boardwalk. Stop and discover what salal is, which tree towers over you, and what birds you can hear chirping overhead. A quarter mile from the trailhead arrive at a second junction. Here, each way leads to lovely, calm Brooklake, but the left route is longer (0.5 miles) compared to the 0.25 mile right route. The longer way takes visitors past a huge Sitka spruce tree and 'Deep Sink', one of a very few remaining peat bogs in the area. These are valuable from an environmental and educational perspective. It's worth taking the long way 'round.Your destination is a quiet place to sit on a bench and contemplate the silence of the lake before heading back. Luckily, this trail loops, so you can take the shorter way back to your car. When you make for the trailhead, follow the trail straight ahead rather than turning right when you head back to the lot.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take exit 142B and turn left onto Highway 18 heading west.

Start by wandering along the Wallace River as it tumbles down from the famous falls.  Get your pictures of the falls, then continue your hike by including the large forested Wallace Lake. Return through a green shag carpet of moss, sword ferns and hemlock, following the North Fork Wallace River as it rushes to meet the main Wallace River and your return trail. First, be sure that you have a trail map for reference. If necessary, take a picture of the trail map posted on the window of the ranger’s booth. Although the intersections are signed, there are many, and it is handy to have something to refer to, if in doubt. Start your hike by following an access road under the power lines. Come to an intersection and a marker dedicated to Senator Frank Woody for whom the trail is named. Stay right on the Woody Trail, enter woods and head downhill toward the sound of the Wallace River. There is a short side trail marked Small Falls which leads to, as you may expect, a small falls. It's well worth the short walk.Once back along the river, there are lots of viewpoints and a few benches. In summer, this is a busy place, as lots of families come here to enjoy a picnic by the river. Start climbing above the river. On a nice day, the light rays that come through the spindly trees make for some good pictures. Stay on the Woody trail when you reach an intersection for the railroad cutoff, and then the intersection with the Greg Ball trail. You will be returning from your hike on one of these trails.  Reach a high point, head downhill on some well built stairs, and cross the North Fork Wallace River on a good sturdy bridge. Once across, head uphill to the Lower Falls viewpoint and picnic shelter. Soon there will be some great views out across the Snohomish Valley and if you’re lucky, all the way over to the Olympics. From the lower falls, you can glimpse the large falls ahead. Keep heading up and in just over two miles from the trailhead, you will be at the middle falls. This is the best view yet of the spectacular upper falls. There is a nice viewpoint with a railing around it that will allow you to get a good look and stay safe. The water here falls is 265 feet, and is visible from Highway 2. Once the picture taking is done, head on up to the last viewpoint, in just over a half mile, where you look down from the top of the falls. To continue on to the lake, look for the trail behind the sign. It may be hard to locate. Some of this trail is well defined, but some of it gets lost in roots and rocks. Look for blue diamonds, about six feet up, on some of the trees, and follow these, and consult your map. This trail climbs a short way to meet a DNR forest road. Once you meet the road, turn left and follow the road for 1.7 miles. While road walks aren't known for their aesthetic value, but keep an eye out for pussy willows, salmonberry, coltsfoot and skunk cabbage in the spring, and mushrooms in the fall. These various flora make the wide road more interesting. But don't get sidetracked by spur roads--your next intersection is signed. Turn right and follow the road a half mile to Wallace Lake. There is a camping area off to the right here, but you'll proceed straight ahead. Cross the bridge over the outlet stream and have lunch at the picnic table on the other side. For better views of the lake, follow the old road along the lake. There are several points where you can climb down and access the lakeshore, but the best views are at the end of the lake. Keep following the trail past the sign for Jay Lake. Cross the inlet stream on some rock filled rubber steps, then hop across more streams. From here, make your way down to the shoreline for some great views of the lake and the surrounding hills. Once done exploring the lake, head back, but instead of crossing the bridge, turn to the right and head down to meet the road. Here you will turn right, and after a few hundred yards on your left, look for a sign for the trailhead via the road. Just past that sign is another one denoting the Greg Ball trail on your left. This is the trail you want. This beautifully built trail is named in memory of Greg Ball, the man who launched the WTA trail maintenance program. The path winds gently downhill, through a green carpet of moss and sword ferns, as it follows the North Fork of the Wallace River. You can see some remnants of the forest that once stood here long ago, old stumps with the springboard holes still visible through the covering of moss. There are some spectacular waterfalls here too. Listen for water crashing through a narrow gorge in the rock.  Take a look, but there are no safety barriers as of now, so stay away from the edge. There are two ways to finish the loop, both end up back on the Woody trail.  Stay on the Greg Ball Trail after it crosses the road, or walk the road a short way, and take the Railroad Cutoff. The cutoff is a little shorter, dropping 500 feet to the Woody trail. Head out the Woody trail, and finish your hike with a view of Mount Index and Mount Baring through the power lines on your way out. WTA Pro Tip: To extend your hike, continue on the trail past Wallace Lake to Jay Lake, an easy flat mile further. There is a backcountry campground at Jay Lake, consisting of tent sites, a picnic table and a composting toilet. Overnight permits are required for camping at Jay Lake and Wallace Lake. Please call the park office to acquire a permit prior to arrival at 360-793-0420. There is a maximum of 5 persons per campsite. Camp only at designated campsites.","driving_directions":"Drive west on Highway 2 until you reach the town of Gold Bar.

At 0.8 mile reach an access point to explore the lake’s stumpy shoreline while taking in views of surrounding peaks, including Copper, Lincoln and Rose. At 1 mile reach a viewpoint of 4,301-foot Mount Rose, whose forested summit rises above the lake. At this point, the trail begins to climb, passing a spur trail on the left that leads to a campsite on Dry Creek. Stay on the main trail, lined with alders and massive cedar stumps. Navigating blowdown can be necessary, especially after storms or early in the season. Though the roar of Dry Creek can be heard, the creek remains out of sight.After another mile, the trail levels out under a canopy of alder and mixed conifer trees. At about 3.5 miles, the roar of Dry Creek fills the forest and the trail reaches the creek. This marks a good lunch and turnaround spot, as Dry Creek is without footlog, making for difficult crossing during periods of high water. With caution, experienced hikers may ford the creek. The trail continues on the other side, but maintenance is limited and the route climbs steeply before entering oldgrowth forest of western redcedar, silver fir and hemlock.Dry Creek is accessible year-round, but spring is an especially wonderful time to visit for both solitude and the display of wildflowers. WTA Pro Tip: Take the time to enjoy the carpets of bleeding heart, elderberry, false lily-of-the-valley, salmonberry, Solomon’s-seal, western trillium, vanilla-leaf, violet, and many more.","driving_directions":"From Olympia, drive US-101 north to Hoodsport; turn left on Lake Cushman Rd (SR-119) for 14.7 miles; turn left, crossing the causeway, and left again for trailhead parking.","distance":"6.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.5014666667","longitude":"-123.320583333","elevation_gain":"800","highest_point":"1600"},{"features":["Ridges/passes","Established campsites","Mountain views","Old growth","Lakes","Fall foliage"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/olympic_peninsula.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//47.7815,-123.0521/@47.7815,-123.0521,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/dscn0957.jpg/@@images/35fc6923-a186-4ab3-9def-65de0e856f26.jpeg","region":"Olympic Peninsula","current_rating":"3.33 out of 5","name":"Tunnel Creek","trail_description":"Tunnel Creek Trail has two trailheads. Nearly all hikers access the trail from the north side where for the first three miles the moderately easy grade is often within earshot of Tunnel Creek.  After crossing the South Fork of Tunnel Creek, the route rises at a steeper but manageable grade past Harrison Lakes to 5050 Pass and some nearby viewpoints. The south side trailhead is on the Dosewallips Road. This segment’s notoriously steep grade to 5050 Pass means it is seldom used. Try it and you’ll find out why.Most hikers access the trail from the north side where for the first three miles the route is often within earshot of Tunnel Creek. This route is 9.4 miles round trip to 5050 Pass.Tunnel Creek has no tunnel. The name comes from the stream’s habit of not visibly flowing and leaving stretches of dry creek bed during low water periods.   The path heads through impressive stands of Douglas Fir and Hemlock. The trees and the ridge of 5050 Pass to the south keep hikers in cool shade in summer and even cold in the shoulder seasons.  At 2.7 miles Tunnel Creek Shelter offers several campsites. Soon you will cross the South Fork of Tunnel Creek on a short bridge that, because of the shade and spray, is often slippery.  There are distracting views from the bridge of twin cataracts tumbling through moss carpeted forest.From here the trail rises on the north face of the ridge, offering views of Mount Constance to the west that improve from peek-a-boo windows to sweeping panoramas at the 5050 Pass ridge top. The trail passes Harrison Lakes, shallow pools nestled into benches on the ridge. On nearly still days, their rippling reflections create Impressionist images of the surroundings. Pick an autumn day for the color show put on by the shoreline of azaleas and huckleberry bushes. At 5050 Pass, there are two side trails along the ridgeline that offer even better views of Constance and more distant peaks and ranges. One trail runs east, the other heads west. You’ll figure it out.","driving_directions":"Head south on US Highway 101 for the Ranger Station in Quilcene for 0.9 miles. Veer right to exit onto Penny Creek Road.

From the warmth of a cozy alpine hut, enjoy some of the best views in the southern Cascades.There’s no sugarcoating it—this trail is steep, and it climbs almost the entire way. But don’t let this discourage you. The views are well worth it. Make sure to practice good trail manners and stay off the ski tracks. From the lower Sno-Park trailhead, start up the road, continuing straight through the first junction in under 0.5 mile. Pass the middle park at 1.2 miles and the upper park at 1.9 miles.

Keep straight at the junction, then reach a low saddle at 2.6 miles, after which you turn right.Until this point, most views have been blocked by the dense forest. Now, clearings start to reveal peeks of Mounts St. Helens and Adams, which will help keep your mind off the steep climb. At 3.2 miles, turn right and head straight up the ridge. Continue straight through one last junction to reach the hut.Sitting on a windblown ridge, High Hut offers outstanding views of the area: Mount Rainier, Nisqually Valley, Anderson Lake, Puget Sound and the Olympics. Inside the hut are a wood stove and cooking utensils. Warm up by the fire and make a hot drink, then relax and enjoy the winterscape.WTA Pro Tip: This route is usually marked with mileage markers, but they can be inaccurate.

You can visit it in conjunction with Sugarloaf or Whistle Lake, two popular locations in the Anacortes Community Forest Lands, or approach it from another trail. This description is via Sugarloaf, but maps of the area, available at the City Hall in Anacortes, as well as the bookstore, the two bike shops in town, and the Mount Erie grocer, are great for creating your own way to access Erie. From Sugarloaf’s viewpoint, head down Trail 238 and shortly arrive at a wooden gate. Turn right onto Trail 226, which descends sharply—300 feet in about a third of a mile. Stay on Trail 226 until you arrive at a “T” intersection. Turn right again, taking up Trail 230. 230 is wide and ambles along a valley floor through open forest before ascending to a junction with Trail 207. Turn right onto Trail 207, which climbs again for about a third of a mile to a junction with Trail 26. Though Trail 26 has a traverse that may look tempting after so much up and down, you’ve still got nearly a mile to go, so proceed straight on to Trail 216. Keep climbing and climbing. You’ll glimpse the road after about half a mile; from there it’s just about another half mile to the summit, which you reach by climbing up and over a large boulder, where spread at your feet is…the parking lot. Fortunately, the viewpoints from Erie are just across the lot. There are several options for your view, but the best are to be found by heading towards the antennae, then taking the trail around to the left of the fence. The viewpoint here includes a sign that names the landmarks you can see below—a much more satisfying summit view than the parking lot behind you. Note that there are privies at the top, as well as wastebaskets and recycling bins. Please be sure to pitch any trash you may have in these. Signs at the summit also request that hikers be very aware that rock climbers use Erie for their recreation as well, so please be sure to not drop anything over the viewpoints!The most straightforward way back to the trailhead is via the road, which includes two opportunities to hop back onto trails and make your way back down. A junction three-quarters of a mile from the summit is marked with a large sign as Nettle Loop or the Mount Erie Summit Trail, and another .1 miles from that is a junction marked for the Sugarloaf summit trail.

This area is actually managed by the state Department of Natural Resources, so be sure to hang your Discover Pass. At low tide it may be possible to hike to the lighthouse by way of the rocks along the water, but beware that there is private property between the two sites. We recommend walking a short distance along the road to the trailhead (watch for cars).This is a lovely, windswept area of grassy dunes and birds. Look for a pair of golden eagles nesting in the trees and soaring on the wind currents. An interpretive sign describes how not long ago the dunes were denuded by rabbits, but how as the population of rabbits declined, the dune ecology came back.A short trail takes hikers to the lighthouse and down to the glacier-carved rocks at water's edge.

Entry is free, and official hours are daily 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. Probably you have hiked the classic Discovery Park Loop Trail. That's a great hike in it's own right, and now you are ready to explore some other areas of the park. Today, you will hike through the relatively uncrowded southeast corner of the park, head up to the South Meadow for the views, then get down to the beaches and enjoy a close-up view of the West Point Lighthouse. You'll come back up to the park highlands by a different route for a close look at old buildings in the Fort Lawton Historic District. The hike will include two short sections of the Loop Trail, but mostly you will be hiking other trails or park roads. Many of the roads date from the days of Fort Lawton and are used today by hikers or the occasional park vehicle. The hike is about five miles long, or a bit more depending how much of the South Beach you decide to explore. Elevation change will be greater than on the Loop Trail, but still just a modest 340 feet. Are you ready? Let's go!The Discovery Park Visitor Center, reached from W Government Way, is open Tuesday through Sunday most weeks, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. (closed holidays.) It offers some environmental displays, indoor restrooms, an information desk and trail maps. Maps may be available at the signboard at the north end of the parking lot.From in front of the Visitor Center begin hiking on the wide, paved path that loops around the east side of the Center and heads south. In about 100 yards, leave the paved path and turn left onto a wide gravel path/road. Follow it east and a few feet before it reaches a paved road, turn right up a short set of concrete stairs. At the head of the stairs, admire the small but picturesque madrona tree with peeling bark. Then continue south on the obvious trail, cross a paved road and climb another short set of concrete stairs. A bit farther along, cross yet another paved road and come to a sign with an arrow pointing uphill and proclaiming \"Loop Trail.\" It's not actually the Loop Trail but it is a route that will get you to the Loop Trail.Follow that route, mostly uphill but with an occasional bit of down, and never very far from the southern boundary of the park. Eventually, you will come to the Loop Trail. If you have hiked it before, the location will look familiar. Head left on the Loop Trail and follow it as it bends around to the right and passes the South Parking Lot.Soon, come to the highest point on the Loop Trail, at an elevation of about 340 feet. A signpost suggests \"View Point\" to the right, but you will be passing that point later today so you can skip it now. Descend a bit on the Loop Trail, cross another paved park road, and continue on a few feet. Come to a signpost where the trail forks. Take the right fork, leaving the Loop Trail. Cross a level field and, in summer, be alert for the sound of hummingbirds that often are seen in this area. Sometimes they perch briefly on one of the trees along the east edge of the field. The north end of the field is bordered by blackberry bushes (not the native variety). Beyond the blackberries, come out onto the South Meadow.Take the obvious path across the meadow, enjoying the views of the Sound and the Olympics along the way. Rejoin the Loop Trail next to the sand dune, and follow it around to the view point that you probably remember if you have hiked the Loop Trail before. Continue on the Loop Trail just a few feet, then turn off to the left on the South Beach Trail. It's a very picturesque route, with views through the trees out to Puget Sound and farther along, down to the South Beach and the West Point Lighthouse. Two viewpoints have been constructed for your leisurely viewing, but surrounding trees grow vigorously in summer, so the views may be better when leaves are down.Continue on down and down some more, dropping nearly 300 feet. As you approach Discovery Park Boulevard, you can't help but notice a large, industrial-looking complex ahead, even though it's partly hidden by trees. It's the West Point Sewage Treatment Plant, a King County operation supported by taxpayers. Smile! If you live in Seattle you are a contributor.When your trail reaches the road, turn sharply left and head downhill on the sidewalk. Soon, the waters of Puget Sound will appear right in front of you. Leave the road and, unless the tide is extremely high, step over a few logs and find yourself on the South Beach. The sand distribution here is somewhat seasonal. Winter storms often move sand farther off shore, leaving the beach more stony. In summer, more gentle wave action brings the sand back in. So your experience may vary.From the beach, enjoy the expansive views of parts of Seattle and the South Sound, with Mount Rainier and some of the Olympics visible in the distance. You'll likely see a few ships and sailboats out there, and a lot of marine birds.You'll notice driftwood structures on the beach, but are they temporary shelters or just sculptures? Who knows? You can explore the beach in the southeast direction for a considerable distance, and enjoy looking up at the bluffs with their layers of glacial sediment exposed by erosion and landslides. But there is no good way to return to the park trails in that direction so you will need to backtrack, then continue northwest along the beach toward the West Point Lighthouse.At sufficiently low tide you can hike the beach all the way around the point for views of the lighthouse from all sides. When insufficient beach is exposed, don't risk hopping on the wet, slippery rocks. Just step up to the pathway next to the fence and retreat east where the fence ends. There, you will be able to enter the lighthouse grounds (yes, it's OK). Head north past the building adjoining the radar mast, and exit the gate to reach the North Beach.The views are as good as those from the South Beach, but you will be looking toward the North Sound, with Mount Baker visible in the distance beyond Edmonds.At low tide, you can hike the North Beach, perhaps all the way around the distant point. But be aware the beach does become narrower, and generally more stony as you continue. At some point you may want to detour up to the park road that follows the shoreline. So, unless the tide is really low, be alert for an obvious path heading inland from the beach a few feet before you reach some trees. If you travel as far as the rock riprap, you have gone too far. The road is just a few feet inland.As you continue along the road, you'll become aware of a high wall or berm on your right, although it's well-hidden by shrubbery. Here and there, a path leads through the brambles to a locked gate posted No Trespassing. As you'll probably guess, it's the seaward boundary of the Sewage Plant, and why anyone would want to trespass there is a mystery. But the postings are insistent. And occasionally, there's even a motion detector that, when leaves are down, may sense your passing on the road and respond with a low-key, recorded audio message suggesting that you leave.As you are passing the Sewage Plant on your right, you may look skeptically at a series of small ponds to the left of the road. But the ponds are not associated with the Sewage Plant. They were constructed to replace natural swamp habitat displaced when the Sewage Plant was constructed, and they are fed by water piped in from Owl Creek upslope from the plant. The ducks relish them, and they are visited by many small animals, including beavers.Eventually you will come to the end of the road. A short, rough path drops down massive stone steps to the beach. You can check out the beach if you like although you may find this section less friendly than the ones you've already hiked. When you are ready, start up the obvious trail on a series of steps. If parts of the trail seem slightly wet, no worries! Here, you are separated from the Sewage Plant by a small canyon, and any moisture you find on the trail is seepage from upslope. Continue on the trail as it climbs steeply uphill, often on wooden stairs or boardwalks. Emerge at the northern end of the North Meadow. If you like, you can check out the apparent viewpoint just to your left, but there is not much to see, particularly when the trees are leafed out.Follow the obvious path heading south, gently uphill, through the meadow. Pass two side trails, both signed for the Hidden Valley Trail that heads back to the South Beach. You can explore this trail a different time. Cross over the Loop Trail, and continue uphill on the paved park road. Eventually, when the road levels out, come to Discovery Park Boulevard, about a quarter mile east of where you crossed it earlier.Cross the road and turn left on the sidewalk. As of early 2015, a temporary fence had been erected along the sidewalk to protect an area where forest vegetation is being restored. Perhaps by the time you do your hike the fence have been removed.Continue east on the sidewalk, and note some of the historic buildings beginning to appear up ahead. The two long buildings on your left, with many apparent covered windows, are the former horse barns -- a reminder that when Fort Lawton opened here in 1900, automobiles and trucks were not common.Continue on the sidewalk. The buildings off to you left along Kansas Avenue are the former enlisted men's quarters, now beautifully restored on their exteriors, some in pale yellow with white trim, others in red brick with the same trim,. They now are private residences.Your sidewalk leads to a pedestrian walkway across another park road, and then the route continues slightly uphill. In just a few feet, find a set concrete stairs heading uphill to your right. Take these stairs, and in late winter be treated to a multitude of wild currant blooms.The stairs lead to another street that arrives from the downhill side on your right, then loops around clockwise and heads uphill, also to your right. Cross just the lower leg of the loop and note an obvious path heading uphill between the two legs. Take that path and head toward the flag pole.Near the flag pole, you will find some information displays. They are worth reading, and present some of the early history of Fort Lawton. One old photo shows logs being removed from the \"parade ground,\" and it's likely the open meadows you see in the park today once were forest, cleared by the army to provide grazing for horses as well as an area for mounted troops to parade. For additional historical comments, see the footnote to our Hiking Guide entry for the Discovery Park Loop Trail.From the flag pole, seek out the often-faint path heading south and passing just to the right of the fence around the radar tower. It really is an official trail and is shown on the map, becoming more obvious as you continue on. The large, restored buildings you see to your left are the former officers quarters. They also are private residences today.Once you are past the radar, head to the right of the old chapel and continue on the path next to a low stone wall. There, find some information displays about park geology and environment. About 35 feet past the information displays the path forks. Take the left fork, continue on it about 200 feet to a paved park road, and turn left on the road. There are no signs there, but you should see a bright yellow fire hydrant ahead on your left. Continue on the road about 400 feet and turn right onto an obvious gravel path. In a short distance, pass under an arbor that, in late winter or early spring, may be exuberantly covered with white blossoms. Descend a few stairs and find yourself at the edge of the South Parking Lot.When you reach the lot, immediately turn left and head north on the paved surface. At the northern boundary of the lot, the pavement ends and there likely will be metal posts in place to prevent traffic from using the ongoing gravel road. Almost immediately, a gravel path forks off to the right of the road. Take it. If you hike this path in late winter you likely will see more red currant in bloom.Other minor paths will join yours from different angles. Just ignore them. When you come to a major path that crosses your route at right angles, turn right. You should see a set of stair railings ahead. It's the upper end of the longest set of concrete stairs in the park (110) and you need to go down them. At the bottom, continue straight ahead on the paved park road. The East Parking Lot and Visitor Center will appear on your right. For the best footing, just stay on the road until you reach the signboard, then turn into the lot to finish your hike.Now that you have completed today's hike, and perhaps the Loop Trail hike too, you have had a proper introduction to Discovery Park. But wait (as advertisers like to say) there's more! Come back and explore other trails shown on your map, such as the Hidden Valley Trail. And check out the Wolf Tree Nature Trail, a short loop through a skunk cabbage bog reached from the North Parking Lot. And, once you have hiked \"all\" the park trails consider coming back in different seasons to see what has changed. There always is something new here.","driving_directions":"From 15th Ave W, just south of the Ballard Bridge, head west on W Emerson Place.

You can't soak in the springs anymore (and they're certainly not large enough to want to), but the rushing waters of the nearby Ohanapecosh River, and the history here make this a great visit for a leg stretch or a hike with little ones. The name Ohanapecosh comes from the name of a Native American village that once existed along the river.

Where it's not crashing over rocks, of course. The Silver Falls Loop takes you upstream along this impressive river, to a majestic waterfall and back through humbling forest, all in just three miles.Here's a short, sweet little loop in the southeast corner of Mount Rainier National Park. Interpretive signs illuminate the past, when visitors flocked here to take advantage of the warm water that was believed to have healing properties. You can't soak in the springs anymore (and they're certainly not large enough to want to), but the rushing waters of the nearby Ohanapecosh River, and the history here make this a great visit for a leg stretch or a hike with little ones. The name Ohanapecosh comes from the name of a Native American village that once existed along the river. The Taidnapum Indians lived in the Cowlitz Valley, indeed, their name means \"Upper Cowltiz.\"ť The work Ohanapecosh is believed to mean \"standing at the edge\"ť.And that's right where you start your hike. On a riverbank, right above the Ohanapecosh River. Proceed into the forest on nice wide tread, following the signs for about 0.4 miles. You'll pass through an open, grassy meadow along boardwalk that carries you above the runoff from the hot springs. This is where the resort lodge used to sit, now returned to a more natural state. Turn right at a junction and head uphill to the main hot springs. The largest pool is quite small, but seeing the water coming out of the ground is fascinating for visitors young and old. Past the main hot springs area, the trail begins to descend via an old service road to the camping area. Stay right, and soon find yourself back at the main trailhead. Extending your trip: The Ohanapecosh Hot Springs share a trailhead with the three-mile Silver Falls Loop, a well-signed, well maintained trail to a stunning waterfall on the Ohanapecosh River. If you're feeling up to it, take a tour of this trail while you're in the area.

It can also act as a mellow warm-up for the steep Rampart Ridge Trail.From the Longmire Ranger Station area, cross the main road to find the trailhead beginning just on the other side. A right takes you on a half mile stroll to the junction with the Rampart Ridge Trail, but you'll want to bear left. Although the trees obscure the evidence, a sign marks an old hotel’s site, a part of Longmire Medical Springs Resort. The resort was established in 1890 by James Longmire, an explorer and settler of the West. Turning right at the junction with the Trail of the Shadows, quickly approach the first rock-ringed hot springs, Soda Springs. In winter, the springs are the only water around that’s not frozen and snow-covered. Many of these springs temperatures range from 50 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. These springs were once thought to have healing properties, and Longmire’s resort was a huge attraction for tourists hoping for relief from a variety of ailments. Visitors paid eight dollars per week to stay at the resort and bathe in the springs.Continue past the springs to visit a small log cabin. The cabin is a restoration of the one Longmire’s son Ecaine built in this spot as housing for the Longmire Hot Springs Resort staff. Ecaine continued the tourist business inspired by the hot springs after his father’s death in 1897, but the family business began to taper off when Mount Rainier was designated as the nation’s fifth national park in 1899, and it ended in 1915 with Ecaine’s death. Soon after, the property was sold to the park. Follow the trail a little farther to reach a second spring, named “Iron Mike,” for its rusty color. Water now at the springs began its journey high up on Rainier and gradually filtered down into the ground and down the mountain. Warmed by geothermal heat, the hot water dissolves iron as it passes through underground rocks and earth. Next, the hot water mixes with colder groundwater before appearing in the spring. As the dissolved iron in the water is exposed to air, it oxidizes, literally rusting in the stream.Don't miss a little marsh viewpoint just down the trail and to the left. Glance down from the view to see a travertine mound by the creek. A sign explains how these mounds form: various mineral forms of calcium carbonate are deposited in layers alongside the stream as they crystallize. As the water rises up from underground the change in atmospheric pressure, along with other factors, changes the water’s temperature and content. Minerals that had been dissolved solidify and are then left on the stream bank to form layer after layer and eventually mounds of mineral rock, called travertine.From here it’s just a couple minutes of walking to the junction with Rampart Ridge. To do the full loop trail, head up the steep trail to the right and continue circumnavigating the marsh for the last 0.2 miles back to Longmire. Throughout your hike, look out for Pacific Northwest fauna. Two frog species, the Pacific tree frog and coastal tailed frog, make their homes in the damp meadows encircled by the trail, using standing water like ponds and faster-flowing streams, respectively, as breeding grounds. Pacific giant salamanders can also be found on the forest floor or in the water.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take exit 143 for S 320th St toward Federal Way.

Expect to cross a half dozen bridges along the way as the trail follows the path of least resistance up the river valley.Before long, you’ll find yourself at the first of the Greenwater Lakes, which tends to feel a little more like a widening in the river than a true lake. A few campsites can be found here if you follow small side trails around the lake.Continue to upper Greenwater Lake just beyond the Norse Peak Wilderness boundary.

Pack a snack on your snowshoe trek and watch the sunset slip below the mountainous horizon or jog the trails towards the beach and take a refreshing dip in summer - whatever you do, you don't want to miss this tucked-away gem waiting for you!Two hike options are available within the state park -- one begins adjacent to the boat launch in the south park; the other is just beyond the reservation booth in the north park.Both hikes are suitable for all ages - elevation gain and level of exertion is minimal. Trails are dirt and woodchip covered in all seasons but winter when hiking trails are packed down into snowshoe trails.During the summer months, various interpretive programs are held along these trails highlighting flora, fauna and historical aspects of Lake Wenatchee.Biking is allowed on all trails except for the interpretive portion of the trail in the South Park.North ParkA loop trail begins at the end of the day use parking area and descends gradually to the Wenatchee River before continuing up river to the scenic North Beach area. The trail meanders along the park boundary and back into the forest as it completes the loop by returning to the parking area. Options to detour on side trails into the campground loops are available, extending the total hike distance from 2 miles to just under 3 miles. Restrooms, picnic tables and a playground are located at the North Beach with views of Emerald Island, Dirty Face and Nason Ridge.The Park property ends at the Y.M.C.A. camp along the North Shore. The steepest portion of this hike is known as \"Heart Attack Hill\". Found just after veering right from the park boundary, it's very steep, but that lasts less than the length of a football field. Common sights along the trail are pileated woodpeckers drilling for their supper, old highway bridge pillars across the river, towering conifers, washed up root balls from across the lake issuing from the White River and Little Wenatchee River and soaring eagles.South ParkFeaturing a trail beginning to the right of the boat launch, the South Park trail has drive-up access. Parking is located next to the camp store, across from the main day use beach. Gently rolling downriver, this interpretive trail guides you along the journey of our salmon friends with educational panels lining the path for a short portion of your trip. Sheltered by abundant vine maple and looming cedar and pine trees, this route guides you towards the confluence of the Wenatchee River and Nason Creek, which merge, then flow under the SR 207 bridge and out east towards the city of Wenatchee. Beavers, white-tailed deer, glacier lilies and the occasional bear have been seen along this trail.The interpretive portion of this trail is an out-and-back hike totaling 1.8 miles; options to extend the hike along the old highway road, towards Nason Creek USFS campground, or along the main beach can add up to more than 2 miles to your trek.WINTER HIKING: Both locations offer hiking/snowshoe routes in winter- routes are initially snowshoe packed and explore areas of the park that aren't always accessible during summer. Towards the end of the winter season or during dry spells, snowshoes aren't always needed, just appropriate winter boots.The South Park trail is marked with interpretive signs portraying animal tracks that add a fun educational element to your snowshoe trek. If hiking/snowshoeing in winter, see bulletin boards for updated trail information and seasonal trail maps, and be aware that hiking or snowshoeing on groomed trails is not allowed.","driving_directions":"From Seattle: Drive 24 miles from Stevens Pass, turn left onto State Route 207 at Coles Corner, drive four miles to Cedar Brae Road.

Surrounding a half-mile stretch of the Chehalis River, this fragile patch of stunning Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western redcedar is among the last, albeit diminished, stores of Washington heritage to pass onto the future forest of the region.At the trailhead you will notice right away that this park is low key. There is no toilet. There is no sign board. For modernity you will have to go to the campground. The trail system is small and simple; the perimeter is a 1.5 mile loop with a few spokes connecting the center. All the trails are reasonably-sized, maintain easy grades, and are fairly obvious, although a map wouldn't be a bad idea (see map section below for a printable map). The northwestern half of the park contains the largest trees, so if you're here for neck-craning admiration try the Oxalis Loop or Woodpecker-Deer Trail Loop. But the entire network of trails is easily strolled with minimal effort. So why not see something you might not expect - a clearcut.Starting at the trailhead, walk west along the grassy path within earshot of the highway. A sign may mark this as the Deer Trail. After a few curves in the trail you'll pass under the suspended canopy of enormous trees that draws your gaze upward and enforces a new posture while lulling your senses into slower motion. Just as the majesty is taking effect the appearance of an expansive clearcut suddenly reminds us that this is an isolated patch of ancient wisdom with a dubious fate.At 0.5 miles the Deer Trail meets the Woodpecker Trail in a drainage. At 0.75 miles the Deer Trail meets the unnamed center trail, an old road, which exits the park to the right or heads downhill to the left to the trailhead. Follow it left, passing a relic structure, and turn right at the marked Hemlock Trail. This southeastern section is a young fringe forest which marks the boundaries of three generations of gene pools; old growth, which is biologically rich, but not very diverse, and clearcut, which represents the potential forest which may one day recover in this valley.After an intersection with the Salal Trail at 1.0 miles, The Hemlock Trail drops down through the generations and once again enters old growth for the final half mile. A scenic cascade and the trailhead clearing mark the end of the loop. Leftover time is best spent by the river, which has its easiest approaches west of the large fir.","driving_directions":"From Chehalis, drive west on State Highway 6 for 16 miles from the I-5 interchange. The trailhead is along the highway under a very large Douglas fir. These is room for many cars, but no amenities.*Note that the bridge across the Chehalis River was destroyed in 2007 by a flood. The bridge used to grant access to the campground and Willapa Hills Trail. To access this side of the park continue west on SR 16 for one more mile, then turn right at Chandler Road. Turn right again at Leudinghaus Road. Find the campground at 19 miles from Highway 16. During low river flow it is easy to ford the Chehalis from the campground to the trailhead.","distance":"3.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"46.6302","longitude":"-123.23185","elevation_gain":"200","highest_point":"450"},{"features":[],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/snoqualmie_region.png","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/078_big.jpg/@@images/6f83d5d3-1779-425b-ac44-016d82bd1463.jpeg","region":"Snoqualmie Region","current_rating":"4.50 out of 5","name":"Blazer Lake","trail_description":"","driving_directions":"","distance":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","elevation_gain":"","highest_point":""},{"features":["Wildflowers/Meadows","Ridges/passes","Wildlife","Dogs allowed on leash"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/central_washington.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//46.3479,-119.4708/@46.3479,-119.4708,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/photo1_large.jpeg-14/@@images/55e6f858-f514-450e-9887-298a77a47bb7.jpeg","region":"Central Washington","current_rating":"3.40 out of 5","name":"Rattlesnake Slope Wildlife Area","trail_description":"Upland birds love this sprawling desert prairie.

You might also find badger burrows in the hillsides of the small side canyons. This region has vast areas of native bunchgrass, and local land managers have seeded more than 1000 acres of the wildlife area with sagebrush to try to reestablish the native ground cover, which had suffered from many successive years of uncontrolled fires.From the parking area, hike due west into the main canyon gully, gaining elevation steadily.

Pond, maybe, but Pyramid Puddle is more like it. Still, this easily accessible trail gets a fair amount of traffic, as it makes for a good spring conditioner or late-fall snow prober. And while Pyramid Lake is tiny, some of the trees along the way are anything but small. The real allure of this trail is the impressive old-growth forest it traverses, compensating for any lake letdown.The trail starts right beside Pyramid Creek. Catch its cool breezes, and then immediately get to work climbing. Under a thin canopy of lodgepole pine, work your way up a ledge. It's slow going, with roots, loose rocks, and tread-choking salal. Hang in there-it gets better.Marching up a rib above the crashing creek, periodically peer over your shoulder through the sparse forest cover for glimpses of Davis Peak and Sourdough Mountain across the Skagit Valley. After about 1 mile the pine and fir forest transitions to mature hemlocks. Come to a branch of Pyramid Creek (elev. 1700 ft) and hop across it to a beautiful cedar grove.Now alongside the babbling waterway, continue climbing. Towering ancient cedars and Douglas-fir soon humble your stature. Make one final grunt, crossing the babbling creek once more to arrive at puny Pyramid Lake shortly afterward. Not much, huh? Actually, there is if you look at this body of water through ecological instead of aesthetic eyes. Rough-skinned newts, those adorable amphibians of the Northwest, thrive here. Look for them floating near the surface and hiding in the detritus. And those big ol' logs floating in the lake harbor scads of sundew, a carnivorous plant. No need for you or the newts to worry, though-they prefer insects.If after observing some of nature's fascinating creations, you still desire a view, try wiggling around the lakeshore a bit and you may catch a glimpse or two of not-so-puny Pyramid Peak poking out above.","driving_directions":"From Marblemount follow the North Cascades Highway (State Route 20) east for 20 miles to Gorge Lake Bridge (just after the intersection with Diablo Road).

Still, this former lookout site is no easy climb. The way is steep and exposed to the eastern-slope sun-hot. But the extensive alpine views from Poe will leave you raven for some time!This is the direct way to Poe Mountain, the trail that once acted as the supply and communication line to the lookout that sat on its summit from 1933 until 1970. It's short and steep, gaining nearly 3000 vertical feet in just shy of 3 miles. A gentler route to Poe can be followed from Irving Pass, but even that route requires a lot of elevation gain due to its up and down ridgeline course. They're both great hikes.

This is a great destination for a day and you can hike as far as you like. Experience the widely varying scenery of the valley floor and the upper rim. The rim trail has spectacular views and can be combined with the canyon trail to form a nine mile loop.Hikers who visit the canyon will be treated to gorgeous views from rock lookouts and, if you go at the right time, lots of wildflowers like lupine and balsamroot, a couple of startlingly green oases, and an enchanting forest at the bottom of the canyon. You will also have a good chance of spotting plentiful wildlife including golden eagle, Western tanager, and coyote, among others. Rattlesnakes do also live in the area, so be mindful of where you tread and keep any canine companions on a leash.Snakes are most active during the heat of the summer. Another highlight is that the trail takes you through a couple of small groves under leafy trees that offer a respite from the sun. Outside of these short sections, the trail is fully exposed to the sun and can get quite warm.Be aware that there are seasonal closures for wildlife in the area and be considerate to other trail users. This is a favorite trail for mountain bikers and equestrian users too.Note that the only water source on the trails is towards the beginning of the loop, where there is a small lake. Especially once it gets warmer out, pack in all the water you might need. Be sure to bring a map with you because the trail branches several times.WTA Pro Tip: All of these adventures can be combined with some excellent food in the valley: Twisp River brewery, Mazama Country Store and Inn, and many fun places in Winthrop.","driving_directions":"From Winthrop, take East Side County Road for 2 miles and turn left onto Bear Creek Road (at golf course sign).

Part of the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project, anyone who has driven cross-state has zipped through this enormous irrigation project, but few stop to enjoy the wide variety of wildlife it supports. At the Wildlife Area, it's possible to do miles of roaming through mineral sand dunes, around lakes that are the reason for the name \"potholes\" in this wildlife area, and get views of the rolling Saddle Mountains. A reservoir makes up the bulk of the water in this area, but because its intent is to gather wastewate and return flows from irrigated lands upstream and store water for reuse, the water level can fluctuate, offering visitors different vistas from day to day. In addition to roughly 1,000 little islands that form when the water is at \"full pool\" in the spring, it's possible to see outcroppings of lava and sandstone, left behind by the Ice Age floods, which shaped this area millions of years ago. On these islands are willow trees, as well as cattail and bulrushes in the more northwest corner of the area. Wildflowers abound here, loving the land inundated with water on an annual basis, but which sees very little rainfall annual. Look for plants of the shrub steppe here, like wild begonia and western wallflower, as well as phlox and balsamroot in the spring. The drier east side is sandier, while to the south lie sagebrush and basalt outcrops. Wildlife too love this area, with bald eagles spending the winter here, while a variety of waterfowl are present year-round. You may even see some enormous sandhill cranes, stopping here in their migration path. Your hike through this area can vary dramatically depending on what route you select, but leaving from the ORV Park and heading into the non motorized part of the wildlife area, you can get about four miles of hiking through sand dunes under your boots. From the park, follow an old fisherman's path along the edge of the sand dunes. As you venture further into the Wildlife Area, the sound of motorized play fades, blocked by the dunes themselves. The way is relatively flat, lined with a riot of wildflowers in the spring, little critters and big game in the crepuscular hours, and impressive views of a landscape scoured by the Ice Age floods.","driving_directions":"To get to the short Dunes Ramble hike, take the May Valley exit (169) off I-90.

All that traffic does a number on the trail, but fortunately WTA work parties have worked hard here, ensuring that all trail users can easily follow the picturesque path to Pratt Lake. The first mile may be crowded, but after passing a junction with the popular Granite Mountain trail, the crowds disperse – or at least spread out. Hike along the wide Pratt Lake Trail, crossing several sweet streams fed by snowbanks high up on the flanks of Granite Mountain. In early spring, these stream crossings can be high, even treacherous, so evaluate each crossing for safety according to your own ability. Three miles in, you’ll come to a junction. The left-hand fork leads to the Ollalie Lake Trail in just 0.2 miles, but Pratt Lake is found by taking the right-hand fork, which traverses the hillside and then begins climbing to a junction with the Island Lake/Mount Defiance Trail after 1.2 miles. Just before this junction, you’ll reach a clear spot in the trail, where Ollalie Lake lies still and green in the valley below you, and Rainier hovers straight ahead. In this open area, beargrass flourishes in early spring. It’s a great spot for a snack and photo opportunity. At the junction for Island Lake, take the right hand path that heads down into Pratt Lake Basin. All the climbing you have done from the trailhead is now reversed, as you switchback steeply down a forested hillside to open granite talus slopes. Here the trail is quite exposed – be sure to bring (and use) your sunscreen. Hike down the talus to a marshy section that sometimes requires bug juice – mosquitos and black flies can be an irritation here, but a breeze can lessen their onslaught. This marshy area opens onto yet another talus field. Stop for a moment to take in the sapphire-blue waters of Pratt Lake before pressing on. From here it’s less than half a mile to the Pratt Lake campgrounds and day use areas.WTA Pro Tip: Camping at Pratt Lake makes a great base camp for backcountry adventures, including fishing (catch-and-release), a short stroll to Lower Tuschohatchie Lake just 0.6 miles away, or a day hike to Melakwa Lake, a more demanding six-mile roundtrip hike.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 47.

The first, Bear Lake is under a half mile from the trailhead on a good trail. Once on the way to Pinnacle, however, the trail changes to a rocky, rooty, muddy mess, slow going up, and slow coming down. The reward for putting up with this mess of a trail, is a nice quiet little lake ringed by rocks and trees, usually not crowded, even on a sunny Saturday.Start out on good trail, reaching a ‘Y’ intersection with a small sign on a tree. The right fork heads over to Bear Lake, a forested lake with good camp spots and a backcountry toilet. Admire the large cedar trees on your way to the lake. After checking out Bear Lake, go back to the intersection and head towards Pinnacle Lake.You'll shortly arrive at a nice new bridge, built by WTA volunteers. Take a minute to look underneath at the sturdy sills (supports) and rockwork supporting the sills and decking. After crossing the bridge, the trail deteriorates fast. Stomp through a large mudhole and get ready to switchback up, climbing ladders of roots and rock along the way. There are just enough sections of decent trail to reassure you that you're still on one. Keep a map handy so you don't get sidetracked by deceptive way trails that deadend in a jumble of brush. Once you reach the top of the ridge, you should be able to see Three Fingered Jack, Glacier Peak, and the tip of Mount Baker through the trees. Look over the ridge for a view of Bear Lake below you. The trail straightens out, passing through a couple of large mudholes, where early in the season there may be snow.  Soon you will reach a large tarn, sometimes mistaken for the lake by overeager hikers. It is pretty, but the actual lake is prettier, and larger. Follow the little stream that heads down from the tarn. The trail is still rough and you may find yourself picking your way through the huckleberries or hiking in the stream itself. What a good way to test those waterproof boots! But the lake lies ahead, with some nice lunch rocks waiting. Once arriving at the lake, admire the spires of Mount Pilchuck, and notice how completely different the view from here is, compared to the one normally seen from the west side. There are plenty of places to sit and have a sandwich, but no level places to camp by the lake.WTA Pro Tip: This area is a maze of old logging roads, and signs get shot up frequently and may be illegible.

Those willing to complete the eight miles and 5,700 feet of climbing needed to reach the pass are rewarded with incredible views of the lake gorge, the Stehekin Valley and peaks stretching from the Cascade Pass area to the Glacier Peak Wilderness. The trail starts just behind the Golden West Visitor Center on the south end of the Stehekin Landing. It follows the Purple Creek-Imus nature trail for a short distance before branching off to the right and beginning its steady climb uphill. At this point, buckle in - you have a long hike ahead of you. Plenty of water is a must-have, because the last source of water on the trail is the crossing of Purple Creek, which comes too early to be of much use. Much of the early trail is still scarred by wildfire, and it's not uncommon for dead, charred trees to fall and block the trail. Trail work in 2011 cleared many of these, so the route is clear until you reach 4,000 feet in elevation. Above 5,500 feet, the trail was mostly spared from the wildfires, so it's only between these two points that blowdowns are a likely obstacle (although this could easily change at any time, particularly over the winter). The trail climbs up the slope above Stehekin for a mile or two before crossing back into the Purple Creek drainage. The trail traverses to the south-facing back side of the ridge on the downlake side of the drainage. This section of the trail is hot, dusty, dry and brushy. Footing at times can be loose and presents a potential danger while hiking. After what seems like an interminable series of switchbacks, you once again cross the ridge line and attain the Purple Creek drainage at 5,500 feet in elevation. The trail starts to yield its rewards at this point - wildflowers, old-growth subalpine firs, and views of glaciated peaks to the north and west. A final traverse of a granite face brings you to the pass at 6,884 feet. From here, views open up in all directions. You'll get partial views of Glacier Peak and direct views of the peaks around Holden. You get a commanding and unique view of Lake Chelan and the impressive face of the ridge towering above the far shore. To the east is a basin full of pine and larch. You can either start back down or follow the trail around an unmarked 7,200' butte to a junction that will take you down to a small lake in the basin or - if you want even more climbing - up to 7,400' Boulder Butte. Either way, it will have been a rewarding day; and if you believe that the effort of a big hike is a reward in and of itself, then there are few trails more rewarding than this.","driving_directions":"Access to this trailhead is via the Stehekin Landing, a small community at the north end of Lake Chelan that is accessible only by boat, float plane or on foot.

The road network also passes by Fort Nisqually.Point Defiance Park offers something for all its visitors, both wildlife and people. From high cliffs overlooking the Tacoma Narrows people can watch bald eagles feed on salmon runs passing through on the strong tidal currents. Their calls can be heard from their nests in the old-growth forest that is preserved and makes up the northern section of the park.In winter, sea lions migrating from California frolic and feed in the swirling tides that rush beneath the Gig Harbor overlook—the northernmost point of the peninsula. Harbor seals are common near the tip of the point most of the year. Seal pups are frequently observed north of Owen Beach in late summer and early fall, though humans and their dogs should keep their distance to avoid spooking the pups.The park also provides habitat for mule deer, red foxes, pileated woodpeckers, Douglas squirrels, and raccoons.","driving_directions":"","distance":"5.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.3049603032","longitude":"-122.516784668","elevation_gain":"200","highest_point":"300"},{"features":["Wildlife"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/eastern_washington.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//48.7329,-118.9816/@48.7329,-118.9816,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/moose-treeana.jpg/@@images/db3d0f52-44d2-4931-9ea4-466e4b2ef574.jpeg","region":"Eastern Washington","current_rating":"2.75 out of 5","name":"Pipsissewa Trail","trail_description":"This trail starts from the campground on Bonaparte Lake, and winds up to rock cliffs over looking the lake.

On summer weekends, the parking lot may be full and the beach crowded. Less well-known is the extensive network of intersecting trails on the steep slopes east of the railroad tracks. The trails, as well as staircases and sediment catch basins, were constructed as a WPA project in the mid-1930s. Today, some of the stone and concrete work shows signs of age, but the main trails are well-maintained and in good condition.For a particularly interesting hike, begin at the upper trailhead at the corner of NW 85th St and 32nd Ave NW in Seattle's Sunset Hill neighborhood. This is a loop hike, so alternate starting points are noted at the bottom. The route begins about 300 feet above sea level and heads steeply downhill on some 80 stairs, followed by a switchback to the left. At the first T-junction, take the branch to the right (the left branch will be your return route.) Soon, head down another flight of stairs (more than 50 total), then cautiously cross Golden Gardens Dr NW. Then head down a few more stairs and reach an area where the slope levels out.To your left is a parking area and to your right a fenced, off-leash dog park. The small building in front of you offers restrooms that usually are open. There is a direct route to the beach just to the left of the restroom, a newly-reconstructed (in 2016) stairway that heads farther downhill. But, for a more interesting hike, save the beach until later.Head north, and when the trail splits into three levels, follow the one immediately next to the dog park fence. On your left, pass a large metal sculpture suggesting an abstract canine form. Soon, the dog park and its bustle will be behind you, and you are on a wide trail through mixed forest. The trees here mostly are deciduous, although there are a few evergreens. Along the way you may hear the calls of pileated woodpeckers and other birds, and from offshore the barking of sea lions.The near-level trail continues on for some distance. Where there is a fork, stay to the right. As always in urban parks, try to avoid minor social trails that may lead out to backyards or streets, or sometimes just to dead ends.Eventually the main trail becomes narrower and more rudimentary, with a few dips and turns, passing grotesque tree trunks. This section is the most interesting forested part of your hike. Press on to the abrupt end at a locked gate -- it's the northern park boundary and edge of a private yard. A picturesque cross-shaped sign on a tree proclaims \"End of Trail.\"Turn around and head back south. The slopes here offer a network of trails, with two and sometimes three levels connected by minor trails and stairs. If you have time or make multiple visits you can explore them all. On your return from the dead end, take the right branch when you come to the first fork in the main trail. Then, when you see a branch to the left that heads up four stairs, take it. In a few feet, at the next fork, take the right branch and head down a few stairs.On your left, you will see a sediment catch basin and, on your right, a set of narrow, rustic steps, nearly 100 of them, winding on downhill. Carefully head down those steps - they offer no hand rail. An alternate to this, if anyone in your party is uncomfortable with these stairs, is to continue on the level path. It will return you to the dog park area, and you can descend via the wide stairs with hand rails, just past the restroom building.Descending the narrow stairs, arrive at an overflow parking area east of the railroad tracks. Continue south at the eastern edge of the lot for about 600 feet to reach a pedestrian crosswalk. Here, history buffs may enjoy a very short side trip. Follow the pedestrian crosswalk uphill onto the road-side sidewalk and, in about 100 feet, note a hint of a trail on the left, with a few stairs. Follow this route just a few feet uphill to reach a sediment catch basin with a commemorative stone rim inscribed \"WPA-1935.\" This may be the only such marker in the park today.Return to the pedestrian crosswalk and follow it downhill where it leads to an echoic tunnel under the railroad track. This is your route to the beach. Head roughly north, continuing on one of two possible paths for about a quarter mile, where the trail reaches two freshwater ponds that usually host a number of ducks. On a cold winter day the ponds may be frozen and the ducks absent.You may note a great blue heron standing quietly next to one of the ponds, or perched in a tree nearby. Also, there are beavers in the area, and it is not unusual to note a tree trunk that has been gnawed, leaving wood chips strewn beneath it. The action mostly takes place at night, so you probably won't see the beaver.Now, follow the beach south for some distance. There are benches and fire pits along the way and, clouds permitting, a dramatic view of the Olympic Mountains across the sound.Eventually, come to a tiny stream that can be crossed on a foot bridge a few feet inland. From there, follow the paved path continuing south along the shoreline. Keep an eye out to your left for the underpass where Seaview Pl NW crosses under the railroad tracks. When you are abreast of it head toward it. Take the pedestrian walkway across Seaview Ave NW, and pass the end of the Burke-Gilman Trail. Then, as you walk through the underpass be alert for any traffic coming behind you unfortunately, there is no designated bicycle or pedestrian lane here.A few feet farther along, the route widens and you will note a trail heading uphill on the right. Take it, do a couple of easy switchbacks, pass the fenced park maintenance equipment yard, and climb steeply. In a short while you will come to the T-junction near the base of your first flight of stairs, thus completing your loop. Ascend the stairs to return to your trailhead.Alternate starting points for this loop include the parking lot near the dog park, or the parking area at Golden Gardens beach, where a large building offers restrooms, and has a small shop at the south end that - when open - offers minimal snack items and beverages.","driving_directions":"From I-5 (Exit 172) north of downtown Seattle, or from Aurora Ave N (Hwy 99,) head west on N 85th St and follow it to its western end at 32nd Ave NW.

This is part of the Sunset Hill residential neighborhood, so please be careful to not block driveways. If you are traveling by bus, King County Metro Route 45 has a stop near here. Also, this corner sports a Caffe Fiori coffee house, and a Mexican-themed restaurant that seems to be open only for dinner.Alternately, if you prefer to park near the off-leash dog park then continue north on 32nd Ave NW.

There are 4.5 miles of trails traversing a 0.75-mile stretch of ravine, which is as much as 115 feet deep. The ravine is crossed in the North-South direction by the 15th Ave NE and 20th Ave NE bridges, which provide an interesting architectural backdrop to the ravine.Park flora include maple, Douglas fir, Western Hemlock, and red cedar.

Even before the historic Paradise Inn was constructed in 1916, the Paradise valley has long been one of the state’s most beloved hiking destinations because of it's southern exposure, giving it a longer season than its north side counterpart, Sunrise. In peak season (July and August) your trip along the Skyline Trail will be filled with views of cascading waterfalls, mighty glaciers and subalpine meadows brimming with colorful splashes of lupines, mountain heather, scarlet paintbrush, cascade asters and bistort. Depart from the Paradise parking lot and locate the trailhead behind the Jackson Visitor Center. The crosshatched system of trails heading out of Paradise is intricate, so make sure to stop by the visitor center to pick up a map if you didn't bring one in your pack. Proceed north, following signage for the Skyline Trail. Continuing on, you will quickly encounter a split for a few ancillary trails including the Waterfall Trail and the Dead-horse Creek Trail. The west leg of the Waterfall Trail is a nice detour in wildflower season as it leads you through lupine filled switchbacks, but for now continue straight on the Skyline Trail. The initial grade from the parking lot is steep, but it will eventually ease into a more forgiving climb after about 0.4 miles. As the intensity of the trail grade lessens, you will come to another split for the Dead-horse Creek Trail and Glacier Vista. Keep right and navigate a few sets of stone-carved staircases where you will be treated to some dazzling views of the commanding 14,410 foot peak known as Tahoma or “great white mountain” to native tribes.\tYou will eventually pass Glacier Vista on your left, where hikers often congregate for some of the best photo opportunities that the trail offers. At 6,300 feet, Glacier Vista also serves as an unofficial turnaround for many visitors who are not enthused by the prospects of taking on some of the more serious climbing that lies ahead. As a result, the foot traffic tends to thin out a bit after Glacier Vista, but be on the lookout for a new crowd, hoary marmots. These cute rodents often claim lazy ownership over the path and can be seen exercising their unique brand of mischievous grazing as they prepare for their eight to nine months of winter hibernation. Although the natural beauty of Mount Rainier incites a powerful desire to explore and wander off trail, you are reminded to stay on the path and avoid approaching any wildlife you encounter, so as to preserve the park’s delicate ecosystem.Over the next half mile, hike along the Nisqually Glacier as the trail loops around in a hairpin turn and moves southeast toward Panorama Point. After that half mile, you will reach a junction for Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. This is the point where summit-bound climbers diverge, destined for the seemingly endless trek up the Muir snowfield to reach Camp Muir for the night. You however will continue straight to the southeast and arrive at Panorama Point after a short quarter mile of travel. Just a shade under an elevation of 7,000 feet, Panorama Point provides stunning views of the Paradise valley, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams and even Mount Hood on a clear day. Panorama Point also has a pit toilet to the northwest that is open in the summer and stands as the highest elevation facilities available to hikers outside of Camp Muir. If you do use these facilities, please make sure to latch the door from the outside when you leave so wildlife does not mistakenly wander in and become trapped. From Panorama Point you will be directed along a path carved into a steep snowfield to the east. Although the signage labels this as part of the Skyline Trail, some consider this section of the ‘low skyline’ to be a shortcut and prefer the more stable footing of the high skyline trail to the north. If you do not wish to brave the steep and icy conditions of the snowfield, continue north up the high Skyline Trail. After half a mile of travel you will loop around and rejoin the low skyline.Following this merger, continue your descent for another half mile and you will reach the junction for the Golden Gate Trail. This is a more direct route back to the Paradise parking lot that shaves a mile off your overall journey, but deprives you of the serene Sluiskin Falls, the Van Trump Monument and the accomplishment of completing the full Skyline loop. So, proceed southwest and continue on the Skyline Trail. You will arrive at the Sluiskin Falls and Paradise Glacier Trail junction after 0.6 miles. The Paradise Glacier Trail to your left is a dead ended spur trail that once hosted views of large ice caves at the edge of the glacier. Unfortunately, the caves have since thawed and as a result the Glacier Trail has waned in popularity. Continue south and you will immediately encounter the Stevens Van Trump Historic Monument, which commemorates the first documented ascent of Mount Rainier by P.B. Van Trump and General Hazard Stevens in 1870. You will then hike 0.4 miles past the monument and arrive at the Lake Trails turnoff, a 4-mile trail that detours toward Reflection Lakes and Louise Lake and eventually loops back to Paradise. If you are not looking to extend your journey significantly, proceed west. After about a mile of travel the Golden Gate Trail will rejoin the Skyline Trail and you will soon after arrive at the sublime Myrtle Falls. Cross the bridge over the Edith Creek Basin and quickly take a left off the path for the Myrtle Falls viewpoint and one of the trail’s best sights. After snapping some photos, rejoin the trail, continue on and a half mile later you will reach the Paradise parking lot, completing the 5.5 mile journey on the Skyline Loop.WTA Pro Tip: While these directions are written for a clockwise journey of the loop, the trail can be hiked clockwise or counter clockwise depending on your preference. Hiking counterclockwise offers a more tranquil beginning and a lower initial elevation grade, while clockwise quickly offers breathtaking views and a number of ancillary trails to explore. There are bathrooms located in the Paradise parking lot at the visitor center. If the visitor center is closed, seek out the second set of bathrooms at the Guest Service building just due east.","driving_directions":"From Tacoma, take Highway 7 S/Mountain Hwy E/Pacific Ave S for 30 miles until you reach Elbe.

The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging. More recently, around the 1970s, the area around Poo Poo Point was logged by its then owners, Weyerhaeuser Corporation. The result is a large clear area used now as a launching pad by paragliders who generally backpack their lightweight gear up the Chirico Trail, or sometimes arrive by minibus.From the parking lot, take the obvious trail across the landing field. Be alert for any paragliders who might be coasting in quietly to land. At the eastern edge of the field enter Tiger Mountain State Forest and find yourself on the Chirico Trail.The first part of the trail, with its steep, forested hillside and many stone steps is very picturesque. If it strikes you as akin to stepping into a classical Chinese landscape painting, you are not alone. Appreciate the magic. This steep face of Poo Poo Point is known as the Yah-er Wall. As you continue a steep traverse across the Wall the trees become smaller and more spaced out, and the hillside-but not the trail-becomes less steep.Farther along, impatient hikers have, over the years, cut some of the corners. To minimize erosion please try to follow the official trail.Continue hiking in regenerated forest and, at about 1.6 miles, come to the South Launch Viewpoint. This  open area sometimes is used by paragliders, and it is a good place for a short break while you enjoy the unobstructed view of Mount Rainier, clouds permitting.Then continue on another quarter mile, gaining 140 feet, and reach Poo Poo Point and its North Launch Viewpoint.The gravel road you see arriving at the Point is the West Side Road, one of several non-public service roads that begin at the Tiger Summit on Highway 18.The Point is a great spot to sit, have a snack and enjoy the view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue's downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle's tallest buildings showing beyond. On a clear day, more distant mountains may be visible.

This is an area popular with cross-country skiers, and you may spot beaver dams and other winter wildlife. From Mardee Lake to looming Kendall Peak before you, this is premiere terrain for winter enthusiasts.For a shorter outing, take a turn around Gold Creek Pond. A one-mile, paved trail in the summer, this one is great for part of a day or with a hiking group that may not want to venture deep into the surrounding forest. Plus, it features stunning views of the Central Cascades, and a lovely flat pond (but don't venture out on it!) If you're looking for a little further exploration, head back into the forest on the east side of the lake, accessed via a small trail that branches off the Gold Creek Pond loop. This road is also used by locals for access to homes, so please stay on the road and respect private property signage. Hike as far back as you are comfortable (2 miles from the trailhead is a good turnaround point, and a nice view of the valley). The Lower Gold Creek Basin narrows to a tight valley where avalanches are prone, so be confident in your risk evaluation before heading too far back. WTA Pro Tip: For another trip to consider if you've never put on snowshoes, try the ranger-led walks from Snoqualmie Pass. The Forest Service guides trips for a $10 suggested donation, including snowshoes. Call the Snoqualmie Pass Visitor Center for more information.

The beautifully shaped Mount Shuksan is the star of the area, with a gorgeous summit pyramid and several impressive glaciers. Mount Baker dominates the skyline in the southwest. Artist Point also is a great viewpoint for the Cascades, with sweeping views of the valley of Baker Lake and in the far distance peaks like Whitehorse Mountain, Three Fingers, Sloan Peak and White Chuck Mountain. Immediately from the trailhead beautiful peaks in the north are visible, such as American Border Peak, Mount Larrabee, and Goat Mountain.Artist Point is an excellent winter destination. The area typically gets large amounts of snow: it even holds the world record amount of snowfall within a season (95 feet). Due to its northern location and a trailhead at 4200 feet, good snow coverage is virtually guaranteed from November to June. In average years, cars can drive all the way to the Artist Point parking area from July until late September, but the remainder of the year the Mount Baker Highway is only plowed to the ski area at Heather Meadows (Picture Lake). In extreme years like 1999, the last section to Artist Point might not open at all. The ski area is small and isolated enough that it does not disturb the peace and quiet at Artist Point, and helps with winter access to this beautiful place.Artist Point is a 4-mile roundtrip snowshoe with about 1000 feet of elevation gain. It is a popular destination, so there is almost always a clearly visible track to follow. Artist Point should be doable for most beginning snowshoers, but there are a couple of steeper (though not exposed) sections that can be challenging depending on the snow conditions. If you venture out with fog or snow in the forecast, then be cautious that route finding skills are critical in this open terrain.The route to Artist Point does go through avalanche terrain, so this trip is not without danger. Depending on the specific risks, it is best to avoid the area when avalanche risk is considerable. Please carefully consider the NWAC avalanche forecast before venturing out (updated every night at 6pm). By carefully picking your route the steepest terrain and the more dangerous avalanche slopes can be avoided, but this requires experience with route finding and snow conditions. The trailhead to Artist Point is at the last parking area on the Mount Baker Highway. No permits nor payment are required. The arrival at Heather Meadows can be a bit confusing due to all the activity at the ski area. Upon arrival at Heather Meadows, continue to drive around Picture Lake (one-way) and past the ski lifts. The large parking area is on the right at the end of the road. The trail begins left of the bathroom facilities. Initially there are typically various tracks in the open, relatively flat terrain outside of the ski area. Depending on the route that you choose, after half a mile there are a few large cabins. At this point, head more uphill to the Austin Pass. During this climb (which gets a bit steeper), there is only a single track, which follows exactly the ski area boundary, which is clearly marked (do not enter the ski area). During this first section of the trip, there is no view of Mount Baker nor Mount Shuksan. Both are hiding behind various arms, but there are already gorgeous views to border with Canada and on the north-face of Table Mountain. Note that you should not follow the road to the Austin Pass. This road is in the ski area, and even if the ski area is not yet open, it is steep terrain with avalanche risk.From Austin Pass, head southwest towards Artist Point. Again, there are many ways to get there. The direct route that avoids losing elevation is a bit steep. It is a rewarding trip to descend a bit into the wide open terrain, just below the summer road (which is usually not recognizable). The final climb to Artist Point is a bit steeper again, and flattens out into a beautiful slightly hilly area, which is where the summer parking area is hiding. With average snow levels, the outhouse of the Artist Point summer parking area is usually not visible at all, but it is fun to try to find it.Mount Baker has been a tease so far: only now does it become visible, with the Ptarmigan Ridge leading to Baker from Table Mountain. Mount Shuksan to the northeast has two large arms, the Shuksan Arm to the west, and an arm to Mount Ann to the south. The Mount Ann arm obscures the views to the North Cascades, but the views on the Central Cascades are rewarding. In the valley to the south, parts of Baker Lake are visible.From Artist Point a short side-trip of 1.5 miles roundtrip to Huntoon Point is a great way of taking in more of the scenery. This point is the natural eastern turnaround point on the Kulshan Ridge, which Artist Point is a part of as well.It also possible to considerably extend your trip to eight miles by circumnavigating Table Mountain via the Chain Lakes (Iceberg Lake, Mazama Lake), but be extremely cautious about the south-facing slope of Table Mountain. This slope is very avalanche-prone and should be avoided if there is any risk of avalanches. A short side-trip to Bagley Lakes at the trailhead is another way to extend your trip, but be aware that this area is more exposed to avalanche risk as well.On the drive back home it is worth stopping at the Nooksack Falls, which is a short walk only, and usually has a nice volume of water.","driving_directions":"From Bellingham follow the Mount Baker Highway (SR 542) to the very end (55 miles).

At the lake, enjoy the sights and relax for a while. If you backpacked in, stay at the campsites for a sunrise and sunset on the lake.The Annette Lake Trail begins just to the right of an information kiosk and the Asahel Curtis Nature Trail. Start down the trail into the forest of Douglas fir, hemlock and cedar. Listen to the sound of Humpback Creek, and in just 0.2 miles, cross over it, pausing here to take in one of the best tumbling falls in Washington. The noise can often drown out any conversation!After the bridge, the trail continues through the forest and passes into an open area, crossing under powerlines, then crossing the Iron Horse Trail at 1.2 miles from the trailhead. The trail now begins a steady elevation gain through the forest with occasional small water crossings that are often surrounded by wildflowers taking advantage of the cool spray. You continue to gain most of the elevation for this hike over the next 1.5 miles. The trail opens up as you traverse several talus slopes offering views of Granite Mountain to the north and Humpback Mountain to the west. These open slopes are also good places to see trillium and glacier lilies coming up through the receding snow of late spring.After the last talus slope you enter the forest for a fairly flat hike to the north shore of Annette Lake. From the lake's edge you can take in Abiel Peak to the southwest and Silver Peak to the east, as well as a waterfall descending into the lake's east shore. The camping area is just a short walk to the east.If you have the time or energy, explore the Asahel Curtis Nature Trail when you return to the trailhead. This 0.5-mile loop is a great one for your camera. The two bridges near the beginning of the trail go over Humpback Creek as the trail leads you through moss-hung trees, swamps of giant skunk cabbage and interpretive signs.WTA Pro Tip: Good places to stop for after-hike socializing and talk about your just completed hike or other adventures include the North bend Bar and Grill, 145 E.

There is a strong chance that you will see wildlife in winter and spring, since an elk herd resides in the area, and with the estuary so close, the area is rife with bird-life. As an added bonus for fall hikers, you can search for and pick chanterelle mushrooms.Dosewallips State Park provides an interesting convergence of forest groves with saltwater delta. The park is best known for its shellfish beds and campground, but it offers some nice hiking too. The 3.5-mile loop trail wends its way through these forests, up ridges and through open meadows. You'll cross creeks and enjoy the dappled sunlight coming through thick foliage of deciduous trees.This area was once the site of a logging operation, hence the unusual name of this loop. A steam donkey was a piece of logging equipment used to pull logs through the forest once they'd been downed. Towards the end of the loop, as you approach the trailhead from the south, you'll hike by a mill pond--this was used in the operation of the steam donkey when the park was an active logging operation.The trail is well-built, easy to follow, and good for beginning hikers. Benches placed at strategic spots along the trail provide a chance to eat a snack or enjoy the roar of the river. Hike the trail counter-clockwise, starting from near the platform tents. Follow the signs for the Steam Donkey Trail. WTA Pro Tip: If, once you've completed the Steam Donkey trail, you want to continue exploring, you can head to another trail in the park.

If desired, take a side excursion along one of the connector trails on Squak’s southern flank for a more intense nature experience.Squak  Mountain is the peak less traveled—and least forested—of the Issaquah Alps. For decades, the Bullitt family owned 590 acres of Squak Mountain forestland, and their 1972 bequest to form Squak Mountain  State Park stipulated that the land not be logged. As a result, Squak boasts relatively preserved old growth forest and ecosystem compared with its more popular neighbors Tiger and Cougar. Like its neighbors, Squak has a complex trail system with many intersections, but you can summit without confusion via the South Access Road.From the trailhead at the parking area, start on the trail leading to the May Valley Loop. At 0.1 miles turn right onto the access road, and climb gently through a forest  of Douglas fir, western hemlock, red cedar, alder, and bigleaf maple. You will pass intersections with a number of trails or their connectors: Bullitt Gorge Trail, Equestrian Loop Trail, Horse Connector Trail, and Phil’s Connector Trail. A brief foray along one of those trails will offer a closer look at Squak’s rich flora and fauna, including cascade Oregon-grape, salmonberry, thimbleberry, vine maple, devil’s club, European black slugs, and Pacific banana slugs.The South Access Road is the most direct ascent of Squak and steadily gains 600 feet per mile of trail. Near the summit, the access road curls to the left, climbing upward more steeply before it curls to the right and reaches the summit. The summit scene is dominated by transmitter towers, featuring a single peekaboo glimpse of downtown Seattle to the northwest.WTA Pro Tip: consider bringing a map and a compass and using Phil’s Creek Trail or the Bullitt Gorge Trail for a descent that is easier on the knees.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, take I-90 east to exit 15.

You have found Thrush Gap Junction, the southern terminus of the Thrush Gap Loop. Turn right to take this 1.9-mile loop counterclockwise and pass by “Manning’s pulpit,” a rocky outcrop looming above the trail, and Squak’s Southeast  Peak near the start of the loop. At 0.3 miles, stay left at a junction (rather than head to the Issaquah Trail Center).If you turn left at Thrush Gap Junction, you can continue on Phil’s Creek Trail, skirting the eastern flank of Central Peak until an intersection with the East Side Trail. Along Phil’s Creek Trail, consider a side trip to Squak’s summit either by the Summit Trail or Old Griz Trail; either option is 0.5 miles long and gains approximately 300 feet. Reach the northern terminus of Thrush Gap Loop at an intersection with East Side Trail. The Thrush Gap is the epitome of the Squak experience, resplendent with old growth, devil’s club, foxglove, and mushrooms such as Fometopsis pinicola, Russula emetica, and boletes; you may even grab glimpses of Poo Poo Point and Issaquah.The total round trip is 8.2 miles: 3.1 miles from the trailhead to Thrush Gap Junction and 1.9 miles along the Thrush Gap Loop (not including the summit side trip). Along the way, watch for black-capped chickadees, Pacific banana slugs and European black slugs, chipmunks, and occasional field mice. At your feet, the trail has been engineered lovingly with turnpikes, drainages, and culverts to endure the heavy rainfall that Squak Mountain receives. Another reason to watch your step is the trails system’s shared use with pack animals.WTA Pro Tip: bring the 10 essentials with you on this excursion, particularly map and compass.

In addition to the Bluff Trail, visitors can experience the seaport town of Coupeville, observe working farms, and get their fill of wildlife viewing, all in a tiny National Park on Whidbey Island.There are two ways to access the Bluff Trail – either from the Prairie Overlook trailhead across the road from Sunnyside Cemetery, or from the seaside parking lot at the end of Ebey’s Landing Road. Hikers who want to enjoy a short beachside ramble would do well to begin at the parking lot off Ebey’s Landing Road, while those who want a bit more of a hike should start from the Prairie Overlook. Keep in mind that both routes do take hikers through private property, so be respectful of property lines. From the Prairie Overlook Trailhead, take a moment to enjoy the view laid out in front of you. Mount Baker rests on the horizon to the east and other Cascade peaks march away to the south. To the west, the Olympics loom large over Puget Sound. Take the view in, then take a narrow, brushy, but thankfully short access trail to a wide graveled road. A sign here points west, leading the way to the Bluff Trail. Stay on the clearly marked route, walking past fields of wheat along the road. The way becomes more rugged as you head due west, changing from gravel to dirt, drawing you ever closer to the coast. Soon arrive at a ‘T’ junction, where you can follow the trail either right or left. Take a right and head up a somewhat steep, but very short hill to a summit with a beautiful view of the beach below. From here, traverse along the bluff, enjoying the wildflowers on the slope to your left and the windswept trees to your right. The trail gradually descends along the bluff, offering an ever-changing perspective of the lagoon below, a birdwatchers haven. Hike until you come to a switchback, and descend steeply through several switchbacks to the beach. Ramble south along the beach until you arrive at the junction with the Ebey’s Landing parking lot. Restrooms and informative brochures are available here, and note that if you start from this parking lot, a Discover Pass is required. Take a moment to learn about the history of the area before climbing two sets of stairs back up to the prairie. Head north along the prairie to the junction you started at, and the turn right to return to the Prairie Overlook parking lot the same way you came. Be aware that there are stinging nettles on the brushy access trail on your return to the car – long pants and keeping an eye out will help prevent irritation from these little guys. WTA Pro Tip: Be sure to stop at Kapaws Iskreme on Front Street in Coupeville on the way back from your hike. This quaint ice cream shop is generous in their portions, and it’s delightful to walk down to the wharf with your cone to see more beautiful views of Mount Baker.","driving_directions":"From Mukilteo, take the ferry over to Clinton.

Franklin and its associated Oregon Improvement Company mine have a storied past which includes the dubious distinction of having been the site of one of Washington State’s worst mine disasters. On August 24, 1894 thirty-seven miners suffocated due to a fire in the mine that appeared to have been intentionally started. The mine continued to operate for nearly 25 years after the incident, but by 1919 coal mining in the area had all but ceased. With no jobs to sustain them most of Franklin’s residents abandoned the town.Now nearly 100 years later, some remnants of Franklin’s past can still be found. Your journey to the town site begins by following a gentle, old railroad grade along the Green River near Black Diamond. It’s an easy walk up to a large coal cart bearing the town’s name.

After about a gentle mile of this trail you’ll come to the intersection with the Royal Basin trail just a few steps before the footlog bridge spanning Royal Creek. Turn right to join the Royal Basin Trail.The trail soon makes a couple switchbacks and though it rises above the creek, the clatter and din of the plunging waters provide mood music for your trek.  You’ll stay left at the intersection with the Mount Maynard way trail and soon enter Olympic National Park. The trail passes through moss-carpeted halls of firs and hemlocks with a few step-over creeks to negotiate.  Soon the trail breaks into talus-strewn open stretches with commanding views up, down and across the valley. The first of these often features a white-ribboned waterfall streaming down a cliff face about a half mile upslope from the trail. After revisiting the creek near some campsites the trail diverges from the waters and climbs via switchbacks again on open slopes.  The trail takes on a pattern of long traverses punctuated by steep climbs.  Switchbacks help you on the ascents before Royal Lake. The two climbs above the lake to get to the Upper Basin are more direct.At 7.2 miles and 5,100 feet of elevation, Royal Lake is a gem. The land around has suffered in the past from overuse that prompted the Park’s camping reservation system. Up valley from the lake is a seasonal Ranger post. Follow the side trail past the Ranger tent platform to a fine view of waterfalls.   Shelter Rock with its massive sheltering overhang is hard to miss on your left as you continue upward. With the rock looming almost directly above you, you’ll cross a short footlog and start striding upward to where the trail levels off at Arrowhead Meadow. Enjoy the views and the gentle grade. You’ll soon be crossing an unbridged stream and ascending to Upper Royal Basin. The blue tarns are to the west and a little bit higher at about 5700 feet.Some off-trail hikers can head even farther from the upper basin, either south over a ridge into Deception Basin or east over a ridge into Milk Creek Basin.WTA Pro Tip: Most of this trip is in Olympic National Park. Camping is allowed only at designated locations and campsites within Royal Basin. From May 1 through September 30, reservations are also required. Campfires are not permitted above 3,500 feet, and bear canisters are required for food storage.

During World War II, the chalet served as an Aircraft Warning Station, and is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It's occasionally used as an emergency shelter and ranger station, but the precarious position over the Quinault River has caused it to be closed to hikers until it is moved. The East Fork Quinault River Trail is one of the most popular trails on the southeast portion of the park and hundreds of hikers visit Enchanted Valley to take in the tremendous views and see the chalet each year.Begin at the Graves Creek Trailhead. At a signed junction, continue left on the wide, abandoned road through towering firs and cedar. Many animals inhabit the valley: bear, mountain lion, deer, elk, coyote, bobcat, beaver and river otter. Look for wildlife tracks in muddy sections along the trail.Two miles in, the old road ends and you'll descend steeply through hemlock and fir to the East Fork Quinault. The Pony Bridge, at three miles crosses the river over a narrow, picturesque gorge lined with maidenhair ferns.The trail continues over a series of ups and downs while paralleling the river. Large firs, spruce, alders and maples line the way. Be on alert for wildlife sightings in between the trees.Just past O’Neil Creek, at 6.7 miles, is O’Neil Creek Camp. The trail ahead crosses numerous streams including No Name Creek and Pyrites Creek, at 8 and 9.5 miles respectively. There are a few campsites near Pyrites Creek.

A very short, 0.3-mile section of the Snider-Jackson Trail traverses through Olympic National Forest, before crossing into the Park boundary. Here a registration kiosk and general park information awaits. It's a good idea to sign in; this is a primitive route. Signage is sparse and the trail itself can be hard to find in places. From the National Park boundary to the junction with the Bogachiel River Trail, it is 6.3 miles with 800 feet of elevation gain -- a lovely forest walk, though the way may be faint. 2.8 miles from the northern trailhead, arrive at a crossing of the Calawah River. This also affords you an opportunity to camp, but note that the river can be hazardous in times of heavy rain or fast snow melt. If the crossing looks dangerous, come back another time. Across the river, the trail begins climbing to Indian Pass, four miles from the trailhead and 1110 feet up. From this high point, descend one mile to the Bogachiel River Valley. A further mile of walking on more moderate terrain, and you'll arrive at the Bogachiel River Trail. At this junction, turn left and follow the Bogachiel River trail for 3.2 miles. Here, ford the river (though there may be no indication of the trail on the other side). Again, be mindful of high water and think carefully before attempting a ford. Between this ford and Tumwata (yes, that's spelled right) Creek, it's 2.3 hard-to-navigate miles.

At under three miles, it provides visitors with a generous variety of nature. Giant spruce and hemlock rise above great galleries of fern and oxalis. The wind whispers the memories of abandoned homesteads in the grasses of shrinking meadows. Owls hoot and frogs croak the song of an ancient melody. One stands here often and wonders about the history here.Sometimes mistakenly called the Sams River Trail, this loop is especially beautiful in the morning or early evening. In the morning, steam rises in isolated patches of sunshine while drops of dew decorate nearly everything. In the evening, wildlife is often seen or heard, especially near the river where views are wide. The sight of an elk herd crowns any Olympic adventure.From the Queets ranger station (likely closed even in the height of summer), find the trailhead and proceed immediately into a grand hallway of spruce, hemlock, and sword fern arranged in a strikingly orderly manner. Follow the trail into a dip which may be muddy most of the year. Cedar and spruce stumps remind one that the Queets, although wildest and most intact of all Olympic rain forests, has lost most of its old growth heritage.At 0.3 miles the trail suddenly joins the river above a fresh bight in the bank. The view upriver frames Kloochman Rock, beacon of the region. The view also sheds light on just how close the forest was cut to the river. At this point the Queets Corridor is 1.5 miles wide – an area inadequate to pass down the legacy of its forest.But there is hope. Young spruce are repopulating the fringes lost to the river. An ancient rhythm still plays here. Testimony to the past arrives in the next half mile, where old spruce and hemlock line up on nurse logs, giving the illusion that one is walking through an enormous castle or cavern, each room separated by living colonnades and curtains of moss.Soon the trail comes out along the road. Follow it upriver, bypassing the campground, to the roads end. Some giant spruce hide among the ancients near the campground. One is 15 feet thick but believed to be only a few hundred years old. The signpost atop the washout marks the old trailhead to the Queets River ford.Follow the trail to continue the loop, passing two paths leading to the left. The first is the new Queets River Trail. Proceed right among large spruce boles then down a dip to a view up the Sams River valley. At 1.5 miles the second side trail drops left to the gravel bars of the Sams River. This route is the beginning of the abandoned Sams River Trail, known today only by fisherman and black bears.Now the trail penetrates a luxurious fern gallery. The forest is open and bright. Young spruce stick out anywhere they can. The trail soon enters an alder grove, weaving in between twisting trunks burdened with exaggerated shag carpets of moss. The canopy sparkles in an afternoon breeze and here there is a good chance to see or hear an owl. During spring this area might be too wet to cross.At 2.3 miles walk into the large field that was once a homestead. Apple trees, some rotten boards, and a rare trinket are all that mark the former homesteads of the Queets. Several paths diverge but follow the field to its far corner and the way will become obvious again. This temporary disappearance, along with all the other trials of a true wilderness, are what sets this valley apart.After the meadow the trail meanders along an old road grade, passing small ponds that create a mirror effect. Soon the road is seen and the way to the ranger station follows it a short distance. On your way out of the Queets, note the forest types of Olympic National Forest, Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and tribal lands. Contemplate the contiguous forest that once stood between Forks and Aberdeen, the greatest forest ever seen.","driving_directions":"This new approach to the Queets uses a number of different roads, but one won't get lost because all of the junctions are marked with signs for the Queets.

Follow USFS 21, also called West Boundary Road, for 6 miles, bearing left at the Y. Bear left again at 2 more miles, and yet again after another one-third mile. Follow the main road to the last left turn, and gawk at a clearcut that marks the boundary of the park. Descend a half mile down to the lower river terrace and turn right onto the Queets River Road. Reach the ranger station after driving two miles through old growth splendor. There is room for several cars (one could also park near the campground, as it is on the loop route). The ranger station will likely be closed, even in summer, as the Queets is the least priority of the National Park Service.

So dam good that the U.S. military constructed a defense post here during World War II to watch over the Bonneville Dam below. A foundation and remnants of a gun mount are all that remains—and of course those fine views too. Survey Table Mountain, Hamilton Mountain, Tanner Butte, the Greenleaf Slough, and Hamilton Island from this oft-overlooked landmark in the heart of the Gorge.Until recently, hiking to Aldrich Butte involved starting on a rutted old road or following buzzing high-tension wires. But now, thanks to the Portland-based Mazamas and the Bonneville Hot Springs Resort, you can follow a new trail that bypasses the old less-than- scenic routes. Named the Dick Thomas Trail for the Mazama volunteer who constructed a good portion of the new tread, find the trail by walking 0.1 mile up a jeep track that takes off from the northwest corner of the parking The Dick Thomas Trail (look for a small trail sign on a lone ash) immediately takes off north, away from the service road heading west. Follow this good trail upward through lush forest, eventually coming to a marshy opening known as Carpenters Lake (elev. 550 ft) at 1 mile. Perhaps it was once, but with the absence of a little beaver carpentry, the lake is now merely a soggy grassy swale. Be sure to cast your eyes upward to Table Mountain and the Sacagawea and Papoose Rocks.After crossing Carpenters’ outlet creek on a small bridge, come to an old road (which sees some ATV use). Turn right, and after 0.1 mile come to another road. Turn left, following this road for 0.1 mile to another junction (elev. 625 ft). The road to the right continues to Table Mountain (Hike 23). You want to hang a left, following the old road up Aldrich Butte.At about 0.2 mile, pass an unmarked side trail that heads to the right to Cedar Falls (be sure to have a map if you explore this and other unmarked trails and roads in the area). At 1.8 miles reach the 1129-foot summit. Trees have been reclaiming the butte, growing within and around an old foundation and gun mount. But views are still good, particularly from just below the summit. Locate Dog and Wind Mountain, Tanner Butte, Gillette Lake, and Munra Point directly across the river. Of course, there’s also a great view of the Bonneville Dam and city of North Bonneville.

There are several designated stock camps west of Frosty Pass, along Icicle Ridge Trail.

The trail has a mixture of forest and sun-exposed areas so you can alternate walking in the sun with resting in the shade as much as you like. Admire the black scars on the Ponderosa pine bark from past fires – this species has very thick bark that protects them against fire, unlike Douglas fir. Enjoy the teaser views of the Icicle Creek valley as you ascend the trail. If you are there in the spring, marvel at the huge variety of wildflowers. It is fascinating to see the changes in the types of flowers and their stage of blooming as you gain elevation. When you can first see the ridgeline above you, you are about halfway. When you get to the ridge crest at a saddle, you will see three tree stumps that provide a nice resting and lunch place in the shade of a grove of large trees. To conclude the day hike, turn right at the saddle and follow the trail for a couple of hundred yards. The trail ends at a small clearing with a couple of horizontal logs where you can see Leavenworth lying beneath your feet. However beautiful it already is at the saddle, it is definitely worth the few minutes extra to go to the right, because of the additional views and wildflowers.From the ridge crest, looking northeast you have a view into the Tumwater canyon. The Wenatchee river winds below, alternating white rapids with placid blue. Snowmelt streams glint silver on dark green slopes. To the north, on the west side of the canyon, Drury Falls races down a vertical rock precipice. Only the 600 foot upper tier of the falls is visible from this vantage point - to see the full 1270 feet you would have to hike Tumwater Mountain – not an easy task. If you’re there after mid-August, Drury Falls may be dry, as it is a seasonal waterfall. Behind Drury Falls, the formidable rock walls of an unnamed mountain spur – unnamed except for Josephine Crag – reminds us of what makes the Cascades so exciting and beautiful.From the east end of the trail, you can see down into Leavenworth, the Wenatchee and Icicle river valleys, and the foothills of the Cascades. There is an almost 360 degree view of the entire area. There is a thicket of snowbrush (Ceanothus) at the end of the trail protecting the viewer from seeing the steep dropoff beyond.Wildlife that has been sighted includes chipmunks, bluebirds, snakes, bald eagle, and grouse. Many species of wildflowers can be seen in April and May. Those that hikers have reported include spring beauties, anemones, glacier lilies, Tweedy's Lewisia, balsamroot, lupins, Cat’s Ear lilies, larkspur, penstemon, paintbrush, silvercrown, spreading dogbane, spear-leaved agoseris, western starflower, prairie starflower, wild onion, geranium, coral root, honeysuckle. Flowering shrubs include thimbleberries, roses, and abundant snowbrush (Ceanothus). For a complete list go to the website of the Washington Native Plant Society and look up the Plant List for the Icicle Ridge Trail.WTA Pro Tip: There are several patches of poison ivy on this trail. Watch out for these leaves and avoid contacting them. The trail is steep in some sections, so be careful making your way up and down. Extending your hikeWhen you get to the saddle, it is also possible to turn left and proceed along Icicle Ridge in a western direction. You have to go several miles from the saddle before you get better views, but then you’ll be able to see the Enchantment peaks, Mount Stuart and Mount Cashmere. Remember that as you go higher, you may encounter snow in the spring.The trail continues to climb along the ridge until it reaches a junction with Fourth of July Creek Trail 1579, at about 9 miles, where it also meets the Alpine Wilderness Boundary. The entire Icicle Ridge Trail is 29.6 miles long and is beyond the scope of this description.","driving_directions":"If you’re travelling US Highway 2 east over Stevens Pass, just past milepost 99 and before you enter Leavenworth, go right on Icicle Road.

As with many “lakeshore” trails, the trail is not actually near the lakeshore.  While the lake is generally out of sight, it does allow the possibility of a hike/canoe biathlon, if you can find a partner with a canoe.  Wynoochee Lake is smaller and calmer than some of the lakes in Washington, making this a nice option.The trail starts near the day use area at the north end of the beach (up-lake from the dam).  Pass several social trails as you make your way through the campground.  These paths head to campsites or to the water, and there is little doubt which trail is the main trail.  Soon you’ll come to a couple of junctions with other trails, but these are well signed.  The first one you’ll see is the Working Forest Nature Trail on your left.  The next one you’ll see is the Chetwoot Campground on your right.  Avoid both of these and stay on the lakeshore trail.The trail crosses a couple of small creeks, losing and gaining elevation each time.  The creeks are pretty small, but could result in wet feet in the early season.  In July, look for foxglove at these crossings, a tall plant with pink flowers.  At the north end of the lake you’ll have a choice – you can attempt a ford of Wynoochee River, or you can continue along the trail for another 2 miles to a good bridge overlooking Maidenhair falls.  This choice is also an opportunity to do a one-way hike and take an alternate form of transportation back.  If you have friends with the canoe, arrange to meet them on the river.  If you’re traveling with companions of varying hiking abilities, arrange to meet them at Maidenhair falls with the car.  Maidenhair Falls and the accompanying gorge is a mere half mile from its trailhead and is a worthwhile destination for waterfall lovers.For those who prefer a long walk, the trail continues along the east side of the lake.  The loop around the lake is 12-16 miles, depending on whether a ford of the Wynoochee River is safe.

Enjoy the surroundings here that are exceptionally green and mossy, and in spring be alert for a few wildflowers.Soon, you will come to a trail junction. This could be confusing because it's not shown on the 2014 or earlier revisions of the Green Trails Tiger Mountain Map. The right fork is the ongoing NW Timber Trail (although in the spring of 2016 the trail sign was reported missing.) Just FYI the left trail fork here, signed \"Master Link Trail,\" is one of several new trails constructed in this corner of the Tigers for joint use by hikers and mountain bikers. Some of these new trails may not be shown on your map, but likely will appear on future map revisions. In the interim, you can find all the new joint-use trails depicted on a map offered by Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance. (Click the Navigation tab to view or download the map.)Stay on the NW Timber Trail, and about 0.5 mi from your trailhead you will pass a very steep hillside, one of the steepest you will see in the Tigers. It's a shoulder of Beaver Hill that you can find on your map. Along the way and in season you will cross small streams that tumble down from the heights (some years, in late summer, they may be dry.)Farther along, the trail enters an area that was logged a few years ago. It's been replanted, and now a few knee-high or taller trees can be seen among the native transitional vegetation. At least it's green and easy on the eyes, and in spring you will find different wildflowers here in this sunnier area than you see in the shady forest near the trailhead.Continuing on, pass junctions with two additional joint use hiker-biker trails, first the Easy Tiger Trail on your right, then the Joy Ride Trail on your left. Stay on the NW Timber Trail, and it will come to an end when you reach the East Side Road (Road 7000,) 2.2 miles from your trailhead. Like many roads in the Tigers, this is a service road intended for use by authorized vehicles so you are unlikely to see much traffic here.When you are ready, you can return the way you came, or can consult your map for other options.Extending Your Hike: For an interesting, but longer and considerably more strenuous hike (8.8 mi RT, 600 ft elevation change,) see Silent Swamp Loop in our hiking guide.","driving_directions":"From I-90 a few miles east of Issaquah, take Exit 25 and head south on Highway 18. In about four miles, turn off to the right at Tiger Summit. Or, if you are coming from Tacoma or points south on I-5, take the Highway 18 exit (Auburn) and head east to Tiger Summit. As you leave the pavement, watch for potholes. Continue on Road 1000 a quarter mile to the trailhead parking area, just before you reach a locked gate. A toilet is available, but no regular water source. A Discover Pass is required here. As an alternative, you could park in the large open area adjacent to Highway 18, where a Discover Pass is not required. In that event, it will be easier to walk up Road 4000 for 0.3 mile to find the beginning of the Northwest Timber Trail.","distance":"4.4 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.4669166667","longitude":"-121.933283333","elevation_gain":"150","highest_point":"1500"},{"features":["Old growth","Dogs allowed on leash","Rivers"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/olympic_peninsula.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//47.9307,-123.0946/@47.9307,-123.0946,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/lower-dungeness-bob-and-barb.jpg/@@images/ae67f0df-a172-4dec-82ff-76feb36af888.jpeg","region":"Olympic Peninsula","current_rating":"3.57 out of 5","name":"Lower Dungeness River","trail_description":"The Lower Dungeness Trail travels through mostly conifer forests along the steep slopes of the Dungeness.

One of a number of trails connecting villages east and west of the Cascades, the Klickitat Trail ran between the east side settlements of Yakima and Klickitat people and the west side Taitnapam (Upper Cowlitz) settlements along the Cowlitz River. Because it crosses the Cascades at the headwaters of the Klickitat River, it became known as the Klickitat Trail. The trail travels in mostly open territory. With the addition of several other existing trails, the entire west side route can be traced. From the Cowlitz River Valley bottom at 950 feet elevation, the Pompey Peak Trail climbs to the ridgetop near Pompey Peak, joining the Klickitat Trail after about five miles. For nearly 15 miles, the trail stays on the ridgeline, always close to a mile high in elevation! This offers a wide variety of landscapes: deep forest, sub-alpine meadows, lakes and tarns, rocky peaks and cliffs, an abundance of wildflowers, and expansive views including Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and the Goat Rocks Wilderness. Near the eastern terminus of the Klickitat Trail, a section of trail descends to a low pass and Hugo Lake, then on to Chambers Lake. From there, the Snowgrass Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail ascend to Cispus Pass at 6473 feet, and the crossing of the Cascades into the Klickitat River valley, where you may spot a faint trail contouring the headwaters. After years of no maintenance, the 17 mile Klickitat Trail is benefiting from a joint effort by Washington Trails Association, Back Country Horsemen of Washington, and other volunteer groups.

You get to go up, over and around mogul-like mounds peppered with volcanic rock, explore the upper rim of Coyote Wall, and descend a grassy slope with uninterrupted views of the Colombia River Gorge. In the spring there is a steady progression of wildflowers, making this an especially good early-season hike.This loop hike begins with Coyote Wall towering above you as you walk down an abandoned highway. Coyote Wall is a 200-foot cliff of columnar basalt that was formed as the ancient Missoula floods swept through the Columbia River Basin. The uphill portion of this hike is on the Little Moab trail (CO3).  On the first half of the Little Moab you get to climb through an area of grass-covered hills, exposed bedrock, lichen-covered volcanic rocks, and the occasional ponderosa pine. The second half parallels the rim of Coyote Wall, giving you close-up views of basalt cliffs with multiple opportunities to peer down from the top. The downhill portion of this hike is on the Little Maui (CO5) trail, which meanders down a grassy slope dotted with white oaks and then descends along a stream with several waterfalls. The Little Maui trail provides postcard-perfect views of the hills above Labyrinth Creek to the east and the Colombia River to the south. The hike ends with a short walk on the old highway back to the trailhead.  Begin this hike by parking at the Coyote Wall Trailhead near the intersection of Courtney Rd. and Hwy 14. From the parking area head east on the old, abandoned pavement as it scoots around the cliff.After 0.5 miles, you will come to dirt trail on the left side of the old pavement. This dirt track is the \"Old Ranch Road\". Follow it as it switches back uphill (avoid the many user-created shortcuts). Shortly after the first switchback turn, you will come to a trail junction. Keep to the left and continue uphill on the \"Old Ranch Road\". After going over two areas of exposed bedrock, you will come to a second trail junction. Again, go to the left and continue uphill 0.3 miles until you come to the Little Moab Trail (CO3). There are some particularly nice views of the Colombia River through this section, so have your camera ready.When you come to the junction with the Little Moab trail, go to the left and follow the trail towards the top of Coyote Wall. This part of the hike may bring out your inner child as you wind through grassy mounds, climb up exposed bedrock, and skirt rocky outcroppings. In 0.3 miles, you will come to your first view of Coyote Wall from the top and another trail junction. Stay left and follow the Little Moab Trail along the upper edge of Coyote Wall where you will have multiple opportunities to view the rocky cliffs that make the wall. After 0.4 miles, the trail breaks out into an open grassy area and comes to the intersection with an old jeep road (CO4) just downhill from a photo-ready barbwire fence. You will turn left on the old jeep road for this hike, but first it is well worth going through the gap in the fence and taking the trail on the left to a viewpoint at the top of wall. With views of the Coyote Wall, Mt. Hood, and the Colombia River Gorge, this makes a good spot for a break.After enjoying the view, go back through the fence and follow the old jeep road east 0.2 miles to the Little Maui trail (CO3). At this junction, the jeep road takes a sharp turn to the right while the Little Maui trail takes off to the left. Go left and begin your descent down the Little Maui trail. The first part of the trail follows a serpentine path through grassy plateaus dotted with solitary white oaks. You can see the hills and rocky outcroppings above Labyrinth Creek to the east, the Colombia River to the South, and wildflower during the spring. The second part of the trail takes you along a stream with small cascading waterfalls. In 0.9 miles, you will come to a junction with a trail going to the left. Keep going straight to stay on the Little Maui Trail. After another 0.1 miles the Little Maui trail joins the \"Old Ranch Road\". Turn left and follow the road downhill.  Near the bottom you will encounter a maze of trails with several options for returning to the old highway.  Keep on an established trail and watch out for mountain bikers. After reaching the old highway, turn right to return to your car. CAUTION: You may encounter poison oak on this hike. Know what it looks like and watch what you touch.WTA Pro Tip: A perfect way to end your Coyote Wall experience is to stop in Stevenson Washington for a snack or dinner at the Walking Man Brewery or the Big River Grill.The Walking Man Brewery serves a wide variety of their own brews along with sandwiches and gourmet pizzas (these are especially good).

On a good day, you can get a bird’s eye view of Mt. Hood and the Columbia River. In the spring the top is carpeted with vibrant yellow balsam root. Although the trail is steep and sometimes crowded, this hike is unquestionably worth the effort.The hike begins with a heart-thumping one-half mile climb through a wooded area to a junction. Turn right and continue your uphill trek. Soon you will be treated to glimpses of the Columbia River through the foliage. During the spring, you may also come face-to-face with wildflowers on the hillside next to the trail. One mile past the junction, the trail comes to a viewpoint where you get a panoramic view of the Columbia River, Wind Mountain, and the top of Dog Mountain. This makes a good picnic spot and turnaround point for a shorter hike. After enjoying the viewpoint, resume your uphill ascent for a half-mile to the second trail junction. Bear right and head up another half-mile to the site of a former fire lookout. The lookout was built in 1931 to watch for fires across the river in the Mount Hood National Forest. The wide openness makes this an excellent spot to pause and take in the scenery.From the lookout, it is only a half mile to the top of the meadow. This portion of the hike is out in the open and very picturesque. However, you’ll need to turn your focus from the scenery to your feet as you skirt the top of a cliff. It can also be quite breezy, so be prepared for gusty winds.Getting to the top is a cause for celebration, and you may be greeted by a swarm of people buzzing with excitement after having made the rigorous climb. This is not a spot for quiet introspection. Instead, join the party-like atmosphere and savor the view. Retrace your steps to return to the car. You can also make this a loop hike by coming back down the Augspurger Mountain Trail. This adds 0.9 miles to the hike, but is more knee-friendly and provides additional views of the Columbia River.

Pass under towering old growth western white pine, Douglas fir, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, and Engelmann spruce—you may need to check cones to tell who’s who!

The trail boasts over 75 varieties of wildflowers, evidence of an old mining operation, and vantage points into the Cascades from two different passes - one is unnamed, the other is Fortune Creek Pass.The trail begins at the end of the North Fork Teanaway Road. Follow the trail as it meanders along an old mining road to a junction with the Ingalls Way and Longs Pass Trail (1390) in less than half a mile. Continue straight and wander through trees, then meadows, cross streams, and gain elevation, making long switchbacks as you go. In the summer, flowers are prolific in the meadows and along streams which cascade gently down the often rocky and otherwise dry terrain. The wide, old roadway eventually narrows as the trail climbs higher along the hillside. Eventually, the trail skirts the slopes of Ingalls Peak as it heads northwest. Approximately 3 miles from the trailhead, an intersection with Trail 1226 heads north to a pass overlooking Lake Ann. Taking this trail to the overlook is worthwhile, and adds just about 2 miles to your trip and nearly 500 feet in elevation. Otherwise, continue hiking straight, staying on Trail 1394. It travels the side hill until finally reaching the barren ridge which is Fortune Creek Pass. The views here open west to Hawkins Mountain, Mount Daniel and Hinman to the northwest, and if one scrambles the rocky hill to the south of the pass, Mount Rainier can be seen in the distance beyond Gallagher Head Lake.

Picnic by the lake, check out the Camas meadow in bloom, or explore the forest and creeks along the many trails. This hike describes a \"lollipop\" loop starting at the south end of the park, visiting the Lower Falls, then circling around through the park past Round Lake and returning along Lacamas Creek.Lacamas Park is ideal for a quick fix of crisp Gorge air. Amid streams and waterfalls swelled winter’s runoff, you’re sure to forget the quaint Camas downtown is but a few minutes away. The park has a diverse mix of interconnected trails that can be linked together in many different ways. For this hike, start from the 3rd Avenue trailhead. If you’re not paying close attention, it’s easy to drive right by and never know this hidden little oasis exists here. Right away, the path parallels Lacamas Creek, often busy with blue herons, standing like statues hunting their next meal. The path is wide and graveled with some rolling ups and downs as it works its way to a picnic spot and Lower Falls. Watch for mushrooms in the forest duff. Cross the bridge, where the trail splits, hiking in a counter clockwise loop will take you uphill for roughly 50% of the excursion, saving the best of the sights for last. Follow the trail, here an old gravel road, taking time to explore the small offshoots. While the main loop trail is open to bikes, the side trails are hiker-only and are clearly marked. As you approach Round Lake, veer off to the left, skirting the southwest section of the lake, where the path narrows again as it winds against the steep shore. You’ll see where it leads up to the small dam and towards the main entrance (main parking lot/restrooms/playground/picnic areas). Rather, take the junction to hike back southeast, following Lacamas Creek and peering down at The Potholes from above. The pools and rock in this area are an interesting feature of the 312-acre park, but also easy to pass by, so keep your eyes on the water as you pass through this section. If the sun peeks out during this time of year, it is likely to do so here, where the trees are a bit open and the angle right for soaking up some sunbeams. From here, the trail continues, narrow and winding, often muddy in the winter months, as it enters an area of cedar and lush vegetation. Remember, this is a quick outing, so just as the going gets really good, you’ll find yourself back at the bridge at Lower Falls.

It’s a long journey at about 7.5 miles, and steep in places, but nothing a healthy dog, child or senior citizen can’t do. You’ll meet all of these smiling folks on this hike during the peak seasons.Located in the Columbia River Gorge Natural Scenic Area within Beacon Rock State Park, Hamilton Mountain can be tackled one of two ways. Try hiking it straight up and down for a six-mile roundtrip, or take the loop for a 7.5 mile round trip. Either way, it’s a great trek.It’s a steady easy pace for the first mile up the wide, well-built trail.  In addition to avid hikers from Portland, Vancouver and elsewhere, you’ll encounter incredible old-growth Douglas fir along this stretch. Wildflowers love this mountain, and you might want to check the trail sides for tasty wild strawberries in the late spring.  At one mile in, you’ll likely hear the waterfalls before you see a trail heading down to the Hardy Falls viewpoint. This is a steep little pitch, and the views are mostly obscured by trees, so if you’re into the big cascading falls, keep on going until you see a side trail leading up to Rodney Falls and Pool of the Winds.  The upper falls is protected by a rail, but you can get close enough to feel the spray. From here you’ll see the lower falls, so head back down to the main trail and catch the falls from below for some great views and photo ops. The rigid Columbia basalt rock makes its presence known at the falls, as these carved rocks stood the test of time through catastrophic floods and landslides that scoured the gorge for the past 15 million years.  The trail gets a little steeper past the falls, but there are some rugged stairs that help out.  At 1.3 miles in, the trail intersects Hardy Creek Trail where the sign declares “Hamilton Mountain - More Difficult” and “Hardy Creek Trail - Difficult”.  Take the “More Difficult” route and continue counter-clockwise up the Hamilton Mountain Trail, switchbacking up for a 1400 foot climb to the top. You can take the Hardy Creek Trail for a 3.2 mile route clockwise to the top to complete the loop, but the better route is to take the Hamilton Mountain Trail up. Plus, it’s easier on the knees coming down the Hardy Creek Trail.    When you reach the top of Hamilton Mountain three miles up, you’ll be rewarded with panoramic views of the photo-worthy Cascade peaks, but it you continue another .75 mile northwest on the narrower loop trail, a prominent ridge will provide even better views! Wildflowers are in abundance up here.  Most people descend the same way they came up, but for an extra 1.5 net gain in mileage, you’ll explore the west side cool lush forest and likely will have it all to yourself.  The northernmost part of the trail is four miles in, where a well-marked sign points the way to the Hardy Creek Trail, shared with equestrians. From here, you’ll descend along an old road bed part of the way. There are signs of black bear in this lesser-used area, so you might want to make a little noise so as not to surprise any if they happen to be hunting for berries near the trail. Near Hardy Creek, there is a picnic table and major trail intersection with a trail sign. Take the left trail (southeast towards the Hamilton Mountain Trail) and continue on this hardy trail that boasts tremendous log retaining walls and bridges along the slick hillsides. After 1.4 more miles, you’ll intersect the Hamilton Mountain Trail and will turn right to descend back to the parking area, unless of course you want to climb back up to the top!","driving_directions":"From Camas, WA, drive 22 miles east on Hwy 14 to the Beacon Rock State Park entrance sign.

During the ice age, icebergs and flowing waters slowly carved away the softer exterior rock, leaving Beacon Rock sticking straight out of the north banks of the Columbia River. Lewis and Clark camped here on their way to the Pacific, and it was at Beacon Rock that they first noticed the tides affecting water levels in the Columbia River, more than 120 miles from the mouth. It was this team of explorers that gave the rock its modern name, though they were initially undecided on whether it should be \"Beacon Rock\" or \"Beaten Rock.\"Its sheer walls were unscaled until 1901, and the modern trail to the top follows that original route. Climbers are still able to scale the rock today, but only on the northwest face. The rest of the rock is closed to climbing, to protect nesting falcons. From a developed parking area on the south side of the highway, the hike heads up immediately -- after all, you have 848 feet to climb in less than a mile. But the grade is surprisingly gentle, with plenty of places to catch your breath and enjoy a view. Moss covered boulders line the wide gravelled path at the base. The trail then curves around to the south side of the rock, where you encounter handrails and a sturdy boardwalk trail that switchbacs all the way to the top of the mountain. Along the way, the trail winds in and out of trees -- surprisingly huge for growing out of a rock mountainside. You'll enjoy views up- and down-river of the mighty Columbia, and far below is a boat launch and the day use area of Beacon Rock State Park. Even on foggy days, the views are interesting and the fog can add to the mystique of the trail. There is also a small lake visible in the meadows at western edge of the rock. This is Riddell Lake, accessible via a wide trailhead at the picnic area at the base of Beacon Rock. It's a nice option for folks who might not want to venture up to the summit, since it offers an interesting southern view of the monolith but beware of bugs! Roundtrip to the lake is less than half a mile. The summit of Beacon Rock features a sign offering you a congratulations on summitting, as well as an expansive view upriver towards Bonneville Dam. Enjoy the view and then head back the way you came.","driving_directions":"From I-205 in Vancouver, drive east on State Highway 14 for 34 miles.

The lake is a great day hike in summer or fall and accessible by snowshoe in the winter. Wildflowers abound in early summer, berries in late summer and fall colors make vivid surroundings in autumn. Valhalla is a popular destination in winter as well, though the access point and the route are very different; see our Hiking Guide entry for Lake Valhalla Snowshoe for further details on this route. In summer, there are two ways to access Lake Valhalla, either via the Smithbrook Trail #1590, or from Stevens Pass using a section of the PCT. Both routes offer similar elevation gain; the Smithbrook route starts at 3800 feet, just 200 feet lower than the Stevens Pass route. However, the Stevens Pass route is longer, while the Smithbrook route is more kid-friendly. Approaching Lake Valhalla from the Smithbrook trail, the grade is modest, and while there is plenty to look at, the round-trip distance is moderate. The trailhead has an ample parking area off Forest Service Road 67. A recent reworking of the trail starts off with gentle switchbacks. After you cross the wilderness boundary, keep your eyes peeled for the 8-foot diameter Douglas fir that fell across the trail a few years ago. This tree was too big to cut with a crosscut saw so it was cleared using blasting.  The trail continues up to Union Gap where it meets the PCT. In August and September, you will frequently meet PCT thru-hikers as they head north to Stehekin and the end of their journey at the Canadian Border. They are generally friendly and happy to share their stories for a few minutes, particularly if you have some fresh fruit or cookies to share. After conversing with thru-hikers, turn south at Union Gap and climb gently to the gap between Mounts Lichtenberg and McCausland where you get your first glimpse of Lake Valhalla, shining in the cirque below. Just before reaching the gap, a boot trail follows the ridge up to an old lookout site at Mount McCausland. Less then a half a mile and 600 feet of climbing are rewarded with a great view of Glacier Peak to the north. There are lots of huckleberries in the meadows along this trail.Pass over the gap and descend to Lake Valhalla. There are a number of overnight campsites and a couple of backcountry toilets at the lake, though please note that no campfires are permitted. There is a very pleasant sandy beach, perfect for lunch. Small 4-or 5-inch cutthroat jump along the shore trying to catch the bugs skimming the lake surface.If you're looking for a longer hike, start from the Stevens Pass parking lot on the north side of the highway, behind the power station that feeds the Ski Area. The first mile of the trail is along an old rail bed, used before tunnels were dug to route the railway under Stevens Pass.  If you look carefully, you can see where the railroad switchbacked up from Yodelin. Watch the downhill side and you will see the clearly graded roadbed ascending, although it has lots of trees growing on it now. The trail continues along the rail bed for another 500 yards or so, where the train was backed in to clear the switchback, before proceeding up and over the pass.  As the rail bed section of the trail ends, head away from the noise of Highway 2 and into a series of meadows. This is a beautiful section of trail, providing a good example of what hikers will find if they continue north on the PCT. A modest grade with well-maintained tread, wildflowers, huckleberries, and good views awaits you here. Mount Lichtenberg looms large above as you climb up to the basin where Lake Valhalla is tucked. This route is 10 miles roundtrip and offers 1000 feet of elevation gain.WTA Pro Tip: Thru-hike the trails to Lake Valhalla using a key swap! Using two groups of hikers, have one group start at Smithbrook and the other at Stevens Pass. Meet in the middle for a picnic at the lake, then swap car keys, and continue on to the trailhead that the other group departed from. This makes for a 9.9-mile long dayhike for both groups through a wide variety of terrain and views.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, take I-405 to Hwy 522 in Monroe. Drive east through Monroe and onto Hwy 2 east for 58 Miles to Stevens Pass. To access the Smithbrook trailhead, remain on Hwy 2 through Stevens Pass. 3.5 miles east of the pass, 100 yards after the highway divides there is a well-marked left turn for Forest Service Road 6700.  Be cautious when crossing the west bound lanes of Hwy 2 onto 6700. The trailhead is 2.5 miles up Road 6700.  From Leavenworth, follow Hwy 2 west to the well-marked turn off for Road 6700, 31 miles west of town. The parking area for Stevens Pass is just 3.5 miles past the turnoff for Smithbrook.","distance":"7.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.7479166667","longitude":"-121.0883","elevation_gain":"1500","highest_point":"5050"},{"features":["Wildlife","Good for kids","Dogs allowed on leash","Fall foliage"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/puget_sound_and_islands.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//47.4680,-122.2493/@47.4680,-122.2493,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/green-river-trail_wafflesnfalafel.jpeg/@@images/60dbe430-710c-45cc-9fe1-828cddb1a3ff.jpeg","region":"Puget Sound and Islands","current_rating":"0.00 out of 5","name":"Green River Trail","trail_description":"At 19 miles from the Cecil Moses Park to the North Green River Park in Kent, the Green River Trail follows it's namesake river through the industrial area near the Duwamish east into the broad Green River Valley, offering changing views along the way.

Near this junction, it's possible to see the old Black River (now dried up from the lowering of Lake Washington). In this area, look for abandoned bridge abutments and pilings from when flat bottomed boats routinely made the trip all the way up to the Black River.

Today, it's only possible to walk or ride as far as Pacific. In Fort Dent Park, follow the River Trail signs, link up the Interurban Trail, and cross a bridge over the Green River before arriving at a BNSF train yard. Passing through the yard, you'll cross the tracks twice. Be careful crossing as some the locomotives are remote controlled. You may also have to wait for the trains to stop or to clear the trail. On clear days, as you head out of the railyard and further south, you may be able to spot Mount Rainier as you pass through Kent.

The midsection of the trail does veer away from the road and passes through a wooded area, but it is still paved, so it's passable by bike, stroller, and wheelchair.Some landmarks dot the way. Herring's House Park is a small green space that features marshes and forest, as well as interpretive signs informing people of the local ecosystem. The habitat is ideal for critters, too.

Visit the Pacific Connections Gardens to see a variety of plant life from  various countries that border the Pacific Ocean, or lose yourself in the many groves of trees that line the paths in the park.  Before being established as a park and arboretum, the land was the property of the Puget Mill Company. After a final timber harvest in 1896, the land exchanged ownership a number of times before the creation of Washington Park. The overstory that shades and protects the various collections of flora in the park has sprung from saplings and seeds that remained from the mill activity. The public park offers many quiet locations for picnicking or relaxing, as well as a playfield and the Japanese Garden in the southwest corner. Aptly named Arboretum Creek winds through the length of the park, and there are many places to sit and listen to the creek burbling along.The park is accessible year-round, but Azalea Way, the main road through the park, is particularly inviting in the springtime. Originally a road for the mill, Azalea Way is now an ADA-accessible path, lined by enormous flowering bushes that explode in a riot of color as warm weather comes to Seattle. At 3-miles round trip, the walk along Azalea Way is an excellent way to get your springtime exercise.

Ball was a former board member and director of the WTA. In 1993 he launched the organization’s volunteer trail maintenance program which has since grown into the largest state-based program of its kind. In 2004 at the age of 60, tragically, Greg passed away after battling cancer. He designed this trail to Wallace Lake and it was finished in his memory by volunteers from WTA and through support from the Spring Trail Trust.Start your hike by following the crowds on the main trail toward Wallace Falls. Soon come to a junction. Turning left, follow the Old Railroad Grade Trail 2.2 miles before arriving at a large toilet facility and the beginning of the Greg Ball Trail to your left. A right turn leads hikers 1.1 miles along the Wallace River before arriving at a junction with the Wallace Falls Trail -- a beautiful hike to three major waterfalls in Wallace Falls State Park.Your route follows the Greg Ball Trail. Pass the toilet facility and follow the trail alongside and above the North Fork of the Wallace River, climbing gently and meandering through maturing second growth. About three miles from the trailhead, catch glimpses of the river cascading down a narrow chasm. About a half mile farther on, the trail terminates at a DNR Road. Turn right on the road and proceed for 0.1 mile to a junction with an old road taking off to the left. Follow this near level forested way for 0.5 mile to the southern tip of Wallace Lake.This is a pretty spot in heavy timber with picnic tables and an attractive bridge, but the northern end of the lake at Pebble Beach is much nicer. To reach it, head left, following another old road. After a half mile arrive at the beach, a gravelly outwash at the base of a small talus slope. Find yourself a nice sun-warmed log and enjoy the view across the placid lake to what is colloquially referred to as Zeke’s Hill and Mount Index peeking in the distance. Savor the serenity here away from the thundering falls and their crowded trails.WTA Pro Tip: Camping is allowed around Wallace Lake and further on at Jay Lake, so you can prolong your stay at this tranquil sanctuary. Overnight permits are required for Jay Lake and Wallace Lake. Please call the park office to acquire a permit prior to arrival at 360-793-0420. There is a maximum of 5 persons per campsite.

It's a quieter walk today, although you may hear some traffic sounds from nearby Highway 18. In early spring, some of the first trilliums to bloom in the Tigers will be found along this part of the trail.Your hike follows trails shared with trail riders (equestrians) and, at 1.1 miles, a sign directs riders to turn onto the \"Horse Bypass\" while your trail continues straight ahead. In another 0.2 mile, your trail narrows and traverses the steep hillside of Carkin's Cliff - the reason horses take a different route. Beyond the traverse, arrive at the sign identifying Hobart Gap, where the foot and horse trails rejoin.Continue east on the ongoing trail and, in 0.8 miles, reach a powerline. Head northeast under the powerline (the route is shared by the TMT and the South Tiger Powerline Trail.) In about 200 yards, turn left at the sign where the TMT leaves the powerline. Stay with the TMT as it traverses 1.1 miles around the east side of South Tiger Mountain. Along the way you will begin to hear the sounds of Holder Creek below. The trail widens and is joined from the left by the South Tiger Traverse.This may be shown on your map as a trail, but that part of the Traverse served briefly as a logging road a few years ago, so it looks more like an old forest road. Turn sharply left onto the South Tiger Traverse (road) and follow it uphill. As it begins to level off there is an apparent fork in the trail, with the former logging road heading left and another wide path heading right. An unhelpful sign proclaiming \"South Tiger Traverse\" is posted in the middle of the fork, with no indication which branch is preferred. Take the fork to the right of the sign and, when the trail levels out completely, look for a signpost on the left. (As of Jan 2015, the sign is missing.) The former sign indicated a trail to the right that climbs a small knoll to reach the Carole Hapke Lunch Area. The actual Traverse heads south on the left, behind the now-unsigned post. You can check out the Hapke Lunch Area if you like, but it's mostly favored by equestrians. A short, rough trail climbs about 100 feet to the top of a small knoll where there is a hitching bar for horses and a fire pit. A few years ago the knoll offered a view of Middle and East Tiger Mountains. But small trees have grown vigorously. Later, the view still was available to anyone who scrambled up a tall stump. But the trees have outgrown even that height, and today there is no view at all.Your ongoing trail, the South Tiger Traverse, continues on south behind the signpost. It passes through an area that was logged a few years ago. An occasional tree was left standing, and today there is a vigorous growth of small trees, brush and fireweed that is much easier on the eyes than the scene immediately following logging.The route exits the cut-over area and enters the forest. In about 300 yards, be alert for a large stump on the left, a remnant from logging a century ago.  Two cut marks near the top suggest eyes, and helpful hikers have scratched in a mouth below to complete the face, but continuing decay may obliterate the \"smile\" in a few years.At the north side of the stump take the unsigned, but venerable trail that climbs a quarter mile up to the south summit of South Tiger Mountain, gaining about 250 feet. At worst you may have to step over or duck under an occasional blowdown, and soon you will be on top. The summit is forested, and there is no view. A USGS survey marker is located within a ring of stones, and the official elevation is 2028 feet.True mountain climbers would smile at the thought of calling it a \"summit,\" but a few years ago South Tiger Mountain actually offered a summit register for climbers to add their names to document their achievement. The register, unfortunately, has been gone for a while now, but you could write a trip report and include a selfie!To continue, descend back to the South Tiger Traverse the way you came, or see Extending Your Hike for an optional visit to the north summit. Either way, end up back on the South Tiger Traverse. Continue on south and eventually come to the powerline. Cross directly under the powerline, pass by a generator, and find yourself on another forest road.Take the road downhill, curve around to the right, and come to another trail. Not familiar? Turn sharply left, walk a few feet, and you will be back at Hobart Gap.From the Gap, take the TMT back across Carkin's Cliff, and continue on to the trailhead.Extending Your HikeNorth Summit of South Tiger MountainFrom the south summit, peer through the trees to the north and you can make out the contours of the north summit about a quarter mile away. It may be a few feet higher than the south summit and, because it was logged a few years ago, it offers the views you are denied on the south summit.Going to the north summit is optional because the first part of the route is quite rudimentary (as of summer 2014.) If you opt to try it, look for a faint path leaving the south summit and heading through the trees toward the north summit. When the path leaves the trees and enters the logged-over area, the next 100 feet or so may be overgrown and somewhat prickly. But persevere, and you soon will come to a good trail. (The trail is not shown on your map, but it's a continuation of the logging road that takes the left fork from that ambiguous sign.) Turn right on that trail and follow it all the way to the north summit. Like the Hapke Lunch Area, the north summit is visited by equestrians and offers hitching anchors for horses, and a fire pit. From the summit, enjoy the view toward the north. East Tiger Mountain is the one with the towers, and is the highest point in the Tigers, at 3004 feet. To the left of East Tiger you can see the rounded, still-forested dome of Middle Tiger Mountain standing at 2607 feet. The high point to the right of East Tiger is known in trip reports as Sally's Summit, although that name has not yet made it onto the topo map. Sally's Summit is at 2786 feet; the third highest point in the Tigers, after East Tiger and West Tiger #1 at 2948 feet. If you have not been to these other Tiger high points they are possibilities for future hikes.Your best option now may be to return to the South Tiger Traverse the way you have come, first going back to the south summit, then taking the trail back down to the Traverse.","driving_directions":"From I-90 in Issaquah, take Exit 17 (Front Street) and head south on Front Street through the town.

Proceed 0.2 miles and look for places to park along the left shoulder of the road. There is no official trailhead parking so that's your only option.

Be alert for spring wildflowers or, seasonally, fall colors. Listen for many bird calls. Enjoy views across Goodhope Pond, a small lake that often hosts waterfowl.Because there are no trail signs in Pine Ridge Park a map is essential, even to follow the hike description below. You can download one from www.edmondswa.gov. It does require a few clicks: In the header, click Services / Parks and Recreation. In the left column, click Visit a Park / Visit a Park (yes, it appears twice.) In the right column click Pine Ridge Park. Scroll down and click the link above the small map (not the link below the Google map.) While the map may show some surrounding streets closer than they actually are, the trail layout is depicted accurately. As in any park, there are a few social trails not shown on the map. Please try to stay on the official trails.If you prefer, you can set out with the map and explore on your own. Or, here is a suggested route that gets to the most interesting parts of the park.From the east edge of the parking area, take the nearly-level Upper Trail and head south. In less than a quarter mile note a sitting bench on the right side of the trail. Immediately past the bench turn right, steeply downhill, on the Pond View Trail. It levels out after just a few feet, heads south toward Goodhope Pond, and ends at the water's edge. (Note some sources spell the name \"Good Hope Pond.\") The shoreline here is heavily overgrown so the view of the pond is somewhat restricted. With luck, you will be able to see a few ducks out on the water. (You will have a more expansive view of the pond from the western shore.)Return to the Upper Trail and head back north the way you came. In about 500 feet note a trail on the left, shown on the map as the Nature Path. Take that trail as it drops a few feet, then levels out and approaches a small pond that is immediately upstream of Goodhope Pond. You may see more ducks here. Then continue on the Nature Path and, in just a few feet, reach the Main Trail. Turn left here and proceed south.In about 700 feet you will come to a more open section of shoreline, next to a bench. This offers your best view of Goodhope Pond. Enjoy it for a few minutes. It's likely some waterfowl will appear for you including, in the spring, some young birds. And it's certain you will hear the calls of redwing blackbirds perched in nearby cattails.Continue farther south on the Main Trail and, in about 200 feet, come to Cole's Cutoff where you'll turn right (Unless you are doing the optional hike extension to Yost Park, as suggested below. In that case, continue south on the Main Trail.) After your right turn, climb a minor hill and reach a trail junction. The left branch leads out to 85th Pl W. Take the right branch, it's the Serenity Trail.In the spring of 2016, a number of small blowdowns were noted at this end of the Serenity Trail, evidence things are not always so serene here. The downed trees have been sawed up and moved off the trail. As you continue north on the Serenity Trail, be alert for the taps of woodpeckers and the calls of crows, jays and other birds. The trail drops gradually, eventually merging with the Main Trail within sight of the parking area.As minor continuations of your hike, consult the map and check out the nearby Cedar Crest Trail and (at your own risk!) the Dead End Path. There also are short spur trails that lead out to neighborhood streets. For a more ambitious hike extension, see below.Extending your hikeIf Pine Ridge Park hasn't satisfied all your hiking ambitions, Yost Park is only a half-mile away. You can easily hike over to Yost Park, enjoy some trails there (see our Hiking Guide entry for Yost Park) then return here. To get to Yost Park from Pine Ridge Park, continue south along the Main Trail beyond Cole's Cutoff. The trail bends around west, approaches Main Street, then passes under Main Street via a tunnel/culvert. (As you approach the southern end of the tunnel the floor rises. Are you over six feet tall? If so, WATCH YOUR HEAD.)Beyond the tunnel, a wide, paved trail continues on south about 400 feet where it meets the dead end of Pioneer Way. This is an area of suburban homes with a lot of green landscaping. It also has quiet streets with little traffic, so it's generally a pleasant walk. Continue along Pioneer Way to Shell Valley Rd and turn right. Continue straight ahead on Shell Valley Rd and enter Yost Park along a gated park service road. Follow the road until it passes the back of the swimming pool, and find the trailhead for the Sword Fern Trail on your right. Refer to our Hiking Guide, and a Yost Park map, for additional information.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take Exit 179 and head west on 220th St SW. Or, from SR 99 turn west on 220th St SW.

Throw in an ample serving of glassy tarns, a couple of wispy waterfalls, an optional side trip to Carbon Glacier and a forested stroll up Ipsut Creek, and you have a photographer’s dreamland.Starting at Mowich Lake, take a short jaunt south on the Wonderland Trail to the Spray Park junction. Merge onto the Spray Park Trail and make a gentle mile-long descent to the edge of Eagle Cliff. The trail then turns east, rounding Hessong Rock and passing the Eagle’s Roost wilderness camp. Shortly past the camp, take the 0.25-mile side trail to Spray Falls, a must-see.After the falls, the trail vaults up 600 feet in the next half mile to the vast Spray Park meadows with views of Echo Rock, Observation Rock, and the Russell Glacier above. On bluebird days, the view north extends all the way to Washington’s North Cascades. Avoid trampling fragile vegetation by remaining on trails through this area. Plants that survive this harsh environment can easily be killed by a single bootstep.From the 6,375-foot high point in Spray Park, begin a 3-mile descent through more wildflowers in Seattle Park, past Cataract Valley wilderness camp to the Carbon River junction and wilderness camp.

The knoll is only a few feet higher than the surrounding area, but it qualifies Poo Poo Point - if minimally - as one of West Tiger's summits. The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging. More recently (1970s) the area around Poo Poo Point was logged by its then owners, Weyerhaeuser Corporation. They even took the stumps! The result is a large clear area used now as a launching pad by paragliders who generally backpack their lightweight gear up the Chirico Trail, or sometimes arrive by minibus. The Point also offers a fine view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue's downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle's tallest buildings showing beyond.From the trailhead on Second Ave SE in Issaquah take the unsigned trail, passing swampy areas and the high school athletic fields. In 0.3 miles come to the first trail sign, placed there by the Issaquah Alps Trail Club to mark the start of the High School Trail. Turn right at the sign and, in 100 feet or so, bear right again, heading uphill on an old road grade. A later sign indicates passage from the Issaquah city limits into Tiger Mountain State Forest. Another sign mentions wildlife, and displays prominent images of a bear and a cougar. They are out there, of course, but the likelihood of a sighting is very slight.Continue on the old road bed, ignoring side trails whether signed or unsigned. At 0.8 miles cross a small creek that flows all year from Round Lake on the Tradition Plateau. At 0.9 miles come to a power line. A few feet to the left a wooden trail sign points to the right up a rocky slope, indicating the way to the Poo Poo Point and Section Line Trails. Hike that way, and very soon come to the signed beginning of the Poo Poo Point Trail. The fainter trail heading left though a wooden gate is the steep Section Line Trail that goes to West Tiger #3.The Poo Poo Point Trail crosses the open route of a buried gas line, then climbs steadily up an old railroad grade through mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. In early spring, look for trillium, bleeding heart, and yellow violets. Later in the summer, be alert for salmonberries or thimble berries. Throughout the year, hikers can enjoy the vigorous growth of ferns and the accumulations of moss on trees.The route traverses Many Creeks Valley crossing a number of small creeks, some of them seasonal, then levels out briefly to cross Gap Creek on a high bridge. This is a great place to pause and view the stream and many large mossy trees. The trail then continues on more steeply through coniferous forest. Note the many old decaying stumps, a remnant from logging days, some of them now appealing abstract sculptures in reddish brown tones.Soon, reach a signed three-way trail junction and the highest elevation of your hike. To the left is the West Tiger Railroad Grade, straight ahead is the One View Trail. Head to the right, where the trail continues to Poo Poo Point, now just a half-mile away. The trail loses 170 feet of elevation before resuming a very gentle climb on an old logging grade to reach Poo Poo Point - specifically, the North Launch Viewpoint. The gravel road seen arriving at the Point is the West Side Road, one of several non-public service roads that begin at the Tiger Summit on Highway 18.The Point is a great spot to sit and enjoy the view and have a snack. There are two picnic tables, and there is a Clivus toilet. There is no regular water source at the Point.

But it's a nice picnic spot, where you can bask in the majesty of faraway Rainier peeking over much-closer Dege Peak, and marvel at the wide valley Sunrise Lake is pooled in.","driving_directions":"From Enumclaw, drive SR-410 38 miles to the White River park entrance.

With stunning 360-degree views ranging from nearby Cowlitz Chimneys to the far-off peaks of Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker, this perch above Sourdough Ridge is terrific for an easy alpine stroll on a clear day. From the parking lot at Sunrise, head north (past the restrooms) up a large set of stairs towards Sourdough Ridge. A gentle climb through Yakima Park takes you to a well-signed Y-intersection. Head east (right) away from Mount Rainier, and climb about a half a mile on a broad trail up to the ridge. From the ridge, you’ll get a glimpse down into beautiful Huckleberry Basin before hiking under the small knoll of Antler Peak. Once past Antler, your views to the north will open up again. Take a short break here to enjoy the vista, listen for marmot whistles, and hang on to little hiker’s hand (if you're with them), as the saddle drops off sharply here. About two miles from the trailhead, a spur trail leading north (left) will climb the last 200 feet to Dege Peak. This small summit is a terrific place for a leisurely picnic (unless it’s a busy day, when good etiquette calls for letting others have their chance to enjoy the summit for a few minutes). In addition to spotting volcanoes and looking for Fremont Lookout, you can gaze out at Sunrise Ridge curving to the northeast and the string of lakes cradled in the alluring basin below. These can be explored on your next visit via the Palisades Trail. When your feet start itching again, it’s time to return the way you came. You can continue on another 1.2 miles and descend to the parking lot at Sunrise Point (the hairpin point in the road), but you’ve already seen the best of this trail in the first two miles. The return trip is when you can really take in the majesty of Mount Rainier. Snap photo after photo or trace the long white and blue tongue of Emmons Glacier up to the summit. On your way back to the trailhead, you’ll also have fine views down into the meadows of Yakima Park, where Sunrise Visitor Center is situated. Seeing where you're headed will be good motivation for any tired hikers in your group. As you gaze down on the broad slopes thick in summer wildflowers or golden fall grasses, it’s easy to see why the wide, welcoming area has drawn people to it for 4,000 years. The history of Yakima Park is both fascinating and fraught—be sure to stop into Visitor Center to learn more and see early photos. Early management of the National Park largely ended the seasonal hunting and gathering by the Yakama Nation here. By the 1930’s, the road to Sunrise—and extensive development of more than 200 cabins and the lodge—opened the area to white tourists. By the end of WWII, the park service had decommissioned most of the structures and camping facilities. In the decades since, extensive rehabilitation has restored the delicate alpine meadows, the only camping allowed is along the Wonderland Trail, and the area draws visitors from all over the world.  WTA Pro Tip: Sunrise Road is only open between midsummer and early fall, and  the parking lot fills up early. The road is usually clear of snow by early July, and stays open through October. Check the road status and expected weather before you head out. You can even check the Sunrise webcam views of the parking lot and views at nps.gov/mora.","driving_directions":"From the White River Entrance of Mount Rainier National Park, take the Sunrise Road up a series of winding hairpins. On the last hairpin, you will pass Sunrise Point parking lot. Continue on to the final parking lot, marked by the Lodge. While you can hike to Dege Peak from Sunrise Point, the facilities at Sunrise Visitor Center and the approach make the case for a Sunrise Visitor Center approach. Facilities at Sunrise include flush toilets, a small gift shop and a snack bar and grill that’s open July-Labor Day.","distance":"4.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"46.9146166667","longitude":"-121.642333333","elevation_gain":"600","highest_point":"7006"},{"features":["Wildflowers/Meadows","Mountain views","Wildlife","Good for kids","Lakes"],"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/mount_rainier_area.png","google_map":"//www.google.com/maps/dir//46.9175,-121.5878/@46.9175,-121.5878,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/palisades2.jpg/@@images/1a8554a3-4bbc-4d17-a249-4a6f8fe8db16.jpeg","region":"Mount Rainier Area","current_rating":"3.53 out of 5","name":"Palisades Lakes","trail_description":"Seven lakes, seas of wildflowers, summer huckleberries, a bevy of wildlife and a good chance of quiet solitude await you on this seven-mile out-and-back hike. What more could you ask for? While the throngs of summer visitors are heading to the end of the road at Sunrise Point, pull off into the corner viewpoint parking area near the top. The trail starts across the road and heads downhill to Sunrise Lake, the first of many you’ll encounter. It’s nice, but keep going. Passing over rocky sections of trail, listen and look for pikas; if you’re quiet you’ll be able to spot them. At 1.5 miles is Clover Lake. Here you’ll find an array of wildflowers surrounding the lake. Again, nice, but you’ll want to keep going. Continue past a small grove of skeletal silver trees and come to Tom, Dick and Harry Lakes’ Dick Camp. It’s often buggy here, and the camp is nothing spectacular. The real gem is the 0.5-mile side trip to Hidden Lake—you will not be disappointed! In the morning light the reflections of the Upper Palisades rocks and Marcus Peak are a sight to behold—and you just might have this place all to yourself. Camping is not permitted here, but you can take a dip in the lake or scramble up Marcus Peak for higher vistas. After you’ve had your fill at Hidden Lake, return to the main trail and continue to Upper Palisades Lake, less than a mile farther. Along the way you will cross a field of lupine with the Palisades rocks towering above. If you start early enough to get here during morning light, the scene is especially magical. Now on to Upper Palisades Lake, the prettiest of all the lakes, replete with lots of wildflowers, big boulders and sandy shores. The water is crystal clear and refreshing—but cold! Several marmots live here. Look for them sunning on the boulders or near their burrows.WTA Pro Tip: Scramble up to Brown’s Peak from Upper Palisades Lake to see some big views of Mounts Rainier and Adams and the Enchantments Range.","driving_directions":"From Enumclaw, drive SR-410 38 miles to the White River park entrance.

There is good access to the Snohomish River where you can find a place to throw a line in the water plus some good birding opportunities near the small lakes.The trail starts as an old gravel road heading downhill toward the river. As you reach the bottom of the little hill, spy Shadow Lake on your left through the trees. Follow one of the paths through the grass to a better view. On your way, look to your left; there is a small seasonal waterfall coming off the hill by the parking lot. If the mud is not too deep or the water too high, you can do some exploring along the grassy shore of the lake.This is a good place for birding both in summer and winter. Bring your binoculars and see how many species of ducks you can spot. In the winter you may see swans here too. They are larger and can be identified by their black beak and long graceful neck. Look for herons hanging out in the shallow, muddy areas along the shore, perhaps looking for a frog leg dinner! You also may see an eagle hunting overhead for a meal.Head back to the main trail. There is another small marshy lake to the right, but it is swampy and harder to reach. That's OK, this is a wildlife preserve and these wet meadows are set aside for wildlife, not us humans. Continue on the path through the grass. In the summer months it is harder to see over the high grass, but in the winter the views are better, out toward Lord Hill and down the river valley.At the end of the meadow is a wooded area and a dike before you reach the river. The main trail leads to the left, but there are many little fishermen's paths to the right leading to prime steelhead fishing in season. In fact, the Snohomish Sportsmen's Association led the campaign to save this area from encroaching development and  preserve the public access to the river. The preserve is named for Bob Heirman one of the members that spearheaded the effort. Go ahead and wander along the dike here, but if someone's fishing, don't scare the fish away!Turn to the left and follow the main trail as it leads through a wooded area over the dike  and heads to a gravel bar along the river. You may have to climb over a few logs to get there, but the trail is easy to follow. Once out on the gravel, you are at Thomas Eddy, a series of sharp hairpin turns in the river. Eat lunch, throw a few wishing rocks, dabble your toes in or just enjoy the view. When you are ready, turn around and wander back the way you came.Extending your hike: Need more of a workout?  Head for nearby Lord Hill, with over 10 miles of trails, one leading over the hill and down to the other side of the Snohomish River.","driving_directions":"Head south on Highway 9 from Snohomish.

The mix of saltwater from Possession Sound and fresh water from the Snohomish River create a unique ecosystem, making it one of the best birding spots in Puget Sound. On this walk, you don’t want to forget your binoculars! The hike starts inauspiciously under the freeway by the sewage treatment plant and right across the river from the railroad yard. Walk fast the first half mile to leave the treatment plant behind and continue along the paved path by the Snohomish River. As it gets quieter, listen for birdsong coming from the thicket of plants growing by the river and alongside the trail. The bright red branches you see in winter belong to the red twig dogwood, a native shrub that thrives in a moist location and is found on riverbanks throughout Washington. Along the way there is an occasional bench to stop and rest. Come to a junction of the Snohomish River and Union Slough, the trail will follow the slough north. In 2 miles you will come to a gravel road and a bridge. This bridge is called Jackknife Bridge, built in 1914. The bridge is one of the few bascule, or counterbalance bridges still standing and is on the National Register of historic places. It gets its name from the way it folded the deck as it was raised. Originally over Ebey Slough, it was replaced in the 1950s and stored in a boatyard. After Spencer Island was publicly acquired, it was towed and placed here. Cross the bridge and come to a T in the trail. The island is divided into two sections, north and south. The north (left) is Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife managed land, hunting and dogs are allowed on this section. For your loop, turn south (right). This area is a Snohomish county park. As this is a wildlife preserve, there is no hunting and no dogs are allowed. Notice the old barn roof. More of it used to be standing, but now it is slowly sinking into the mud. Walk down to the viewing platform and look for herons. Once back on the path, you will see a trail on top of a levee heading out across the water, this is your return. For now, continue down the wide gravel path and cross a long bridge. Make a note of a stump or log in the water. When you finish the loop, check back and see how far down, or up, the water has come--this area responds to the nearby tidal influence of Puget Sound. There used to be a dike here, but the dikes on this side of the island were breached to allow salt water to return with the tides and restore habitat for juvenile salmon. This will encourage more native plant growth and in turn provide a more varied environment for other wildlife. Cattails are one plentiful plant growing here that will hopefully beat out the invasive canary reed grass that was planted when this area was agricultural. Cattail roots thrive in the low oxygen environment of shallow standing water. Where there are cattails, there will be blackbirds, so listen for their distinctive song in the spring. Did you know that the female blackbird is not black like the male, but brown? Look for her hidden among the cattail stems. Note also the wood duck nest boxes and bat houses along the trail and listen for marsh wrens. As you come around to the back side of the loop, you will be following Steamboat Slough. There is lots of brush along this section; if you get lucky, you may see a river otter or maybe a deer. On your left you will see your return trail on top of the levee. The trail in front of you just ends at a breach. Once on top of the levee, you should get some great views of the water-filled island. Here is where to look for ducks, mergansers, green winged teals, buffleheads and of course mallards and lots of Canadian geese. Watch for eagles and hawks above. Cross a bridge and directly west is the Everett skyline. Look north and there will be Mount Baker, east Pilchuck and Three Fingers. You may see the tip of Mount Rainier to the south if the sky is clear. Once across, head right, back to Jackknife Bridge and your return. From here, go the way you came, or keep straight on the gravel road. The gravel road will take you back past the sewage lagoons, a shorter, but less scenic route. WTA Pro Tip: The north side trail is brushy and somewhat overgrown, but offers more wildlife viewing opportunities and good views of Mount Rainier.  Parking just after the Y and taking the river trail from there will add more mileage.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take the Marine View Drive Exit 195.

Formerly an old road bed, the trail begins as a flat path through mossy forests of redcedar, salal, and one or two small tallgrass fields. These meadows are being reclaimed from the invasive scotch broom plant, thanks to local community efforts. A third of a mile down the old road, it forks, and you can continue on the old road, or take the righthand branch and enjoy a slightly longer route. Both trails meet up at a junction, for a lollipop loop option, take one on the way to the beach, and one on the way back. Either way, the greenery of the forest surrounds you. Listen for birdcalls and look for other trail users – equestrians use this trail occasionally, though the route down to the beach is hiker-only. Arrive at a junction. To your right is Gazzam Lake, where waterfowl and other birds make their home. Listen for their calls as you turn left if you came from the main road (straight ahead if you came from the other trail). Keep the lake on your right, and don’t fret – you’ll get to take a closer look soon.Soon a small ‘Lake Access’ trail appears on your right. Duck down this to get a better look, if you wish. Otherwise continue on the main trail, where, a mile after last junction, you arrive at a ‘T’ intersection. The road to your right leads to the Marshall Hill parking area. This parking lot provides closer access for those wanting the most direct route to the beach. Take the Westwood Shore trail to your left (hiker-only after the interpretive sign (.4 mile) and enjoy your last few hundred feet of relatively flat hiking. About a quarter-mile from the third junction, the trail begins to descend, gradually at first, but then the grade becomes steeper. As the water comes into view, the trail appears to head straight downhill, but stick with it – traverse across the hillside into some rollicking switchbacks that funnel you down to a staircase for the very last pitch onto the beach. Enjoy your lunch here and refuel for the climb back up. WTA Pro Tip: For the enterprising hiker, Peter’s Trail is a nice add-on from the Deerpath trailhead. It's a narrow, brushy trail wending through closer forest than the Gazzam Lake trail. It's a mile and a half round trip; do it before tackling the Gazzam Lake trail, since you won’t feel much like it afterwards, and it serves as a nice warm-up.","driving_directions":"From the ferry terminal on Bainbridge, drive to the first stoplight and turn left onto Winslow Way.

Start with a couple miles of gentle up-and-down, through forest coated with thick mosses, with glimpses of a crashing river that’s an ethereal shade of blue-green. Then begin steadily climbing up switchbacks, the beginning of your journey through an aging forest fire, and on to views of a verdant river valley rolling out at your feet. An added bonus – this is one of WTA’s most frequently-visited trails. Trees in the burn area fall routinely, so the access you enjoy to these surroundings is thanks to volunteer crews who visit this trail year after year to remove them. Begin from the trailhead parking area and immediately head gently uphill along a wide, rocky tread through thick forest. A creek runs along the inside of this former roadbed, so WTA crews have installed drainage structures along this first mile of trail, to keep the small stream from eroding the trail away. As the trail curves around to the left, take in the enormous bigleaf maples that line the way, and listen to the wind sighing through the trees. After a mile, pass a sign indicating The Brothers Wilderness. Descend a short hill, then follow the trail as it flattens out through some stunning fir and pines. WTA wields their tools here as well, evening tread and providing sturdier footing for hikers. Two miles from the trailhead you have your first glimpse of the Duckabush River. Hike alongside this mighty river, which may be silty from spring runoff, or crystal clear in winter. Head upstream about half a mile before an enchanting glen opens up before you. Hikers are dwarfed by enormous cedars, and pillowy moss spreads out in all directions from your boots. Soon you’ll begin climbing Big Hump. The first assault is a series of tight switchbacks on black rock dotted with colorful lichen to an overlook. This is informally known as 'Snack Rock'. Have a bite, then continue here through a large section of the 2011 Duckabush Fire. This is where WTA work crews have made their mark. Each year, at least three backcountry response teams make the trek back here to log out hundreds of trees that fall to winter storms. In 2015, a crew even headed up for a soggy weekend in November and removed 80 trees over the course of four days! The trail meanders through this area, then continues switchbacking uphill to the crest of Big Hump. Enjoy views from the top, and look down, on the north side of the hill. There’s a camp down there, 650 feet down and about 5 miles from the trailhead (hence its apt name, Fivemile Camp). If you’re looking for a good picnic spot, head down there.

You’d miss a half-dozen waterfalls and some of the finest old-growth forest in the Gorge—plus the workout of your life! Follow a historical trail to the top of this ancient volcano, and gaze out at five active volcanoes from its open summit. The distance is long and the elevation grand, but most of the grade is moderate, following alongside tumbling creeks nearly the entire way. Just don’t expect a golden forest streaking the mountain come fall—there are no larches.Constructed in 1915 by the Progressive Business Men’s Club (which included some of Portland’s most prominent citizens), a fledgling U.S. Forest Service, timber baron and philanthropist Simon Benson, and the Trails Club of Oregon (which was officially formed on Larch Mountain), this trail’s history is as varied and fascinating as the terrain it traverses.Start at the Multnomah Falls Lodge, following the paved path past Oregon’s most prominent waterfall and maneuvering between hordes of hikers. At 1.1 miles pass a spur that leads to the upper viewpoint of Multnomah Falls, and leave the majority of the masses behind.Cross Multnomah Creek, following it upstream past Dutchman, Wiesendanger, and Ecola Falls, coming to the junction with the Wahkeena Trail at 1.8 miles (elev. 1200 ft; different from the Wahkeena Falls Trail). Continue left along Multnomah Creek into a lush and damp rainforest-like valley. Cross the creek on a high bridge and rock hop across several side creeks. At 2.7 miles the trail (elev. 1600 ft) splits into two routes—high- and low-water routes. The high route is slightly longer and involves some climbing. If winter rains have flooded the low route, you’ll be heading up!At 3 miles come to the closed Multnomah Basin Road (elev. 1650 ft). This old dirt road winds east 1 mile to the basin (more a flat) and to the Trails Club of Oregon’s Nesika Lodge (open to members and their guests only). Continue south on the trail, soon entering land that was a 2009 addition to the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness (see “Untrammeled Columbia River Gorge” in this section). Some of the finest old growth remaining in the Columbia Gorge can be found on the lower slopes of Larch Mountain and along nearby Franklin Ridge and Bells Creek. These areas’ inclusion as wilderness assures their permanent protection.At 3.3 miles the Franklin Ridge Trail (Hike 71) veers left. Continue right, through groves of ancient hemlock and fir—but no larch. Early lumberman erroneously referred to noble fir as larch (which grows on the drier eastern slopes of the Cascades), and a number of Larch Mountains popped up in western Washington and Oregon. Soon cross the West Fork Multnomah Creek using a log bridge, and at 3.9 miles cross the East Fork. Multnomah Creek is spring fed like many of the creeks in the Columbia River Gorge.Climbing at a moderate grade, the trail veers away from the creek and traverses a large scree slope. At 5 miles, leave wilderness and come to the Multnomah Creek Trail (elev. 2950 ft). The Larch Mountain Trail continues right, steadily ascending a ridge rife with rhododendron. At 5.4 miles, intersect an old road (elev. 3300 ft) that provides hikers and mountain bikers a shortcut from the Larch Mountain Road.Continue ascending through thick woods, reaching picnic tables and (gasp) a road (elev. 3850 ft) at 6.9 miles. Built in the 1930s as a Depression-works project, the paved Larch Mountain Road allows folks to enjoy the views you are about to receive without putting in the work! Try to make this hike in late spring after snow melt and before the road opens (which varies year to year) to enjoy summit solitude.Locate the 0.3-mile paved Sherrard Point Trail (named for the forest supervisor at the time of the road’s construction) and follow it to the fenced-in rocky and open 4055-foot summit. Wow! From this ancient shield volcano (the caldera is right below you), gaze out at five of the Northwest’s most prominent active volcanoes: Hood, Jefferson, Adams, Saint Helens, and Rainier. Gaze out over the Gorge too. And if it’s early summer, don’t forget to cast your eyes downward to the showy rock gardens adorning the summit.","driving_directions":"From Portland, follow I-84 east and take exit 31.

And with wildflowers in spring, blueberry bushes for trail-side snacking in late summer and blazing color in the fall, you can't pick a bad season to visit.Since this is a loop hike accessible from three separate parking lots, there are many options for this adventure, though as is often the case, some choices are better than others. This description addresses two directions of the same loop, which both offer stunning views and plenty of trailside rewards along the way.From the Artist Point parking lot, hike counter-clockwise. This gets the steep, road-adjacent Wild Goose section out of the way by descending it first and then climbing up to Herman Saddle. This direction means you'll hit the high point of the loop on fresh, strong legs, and allows you to enjoy the lakes and milder hiking later in the day.From the Artist Point parking lot, look for the privy. Just to the right of it is an unmarked trail. Follow this down a short ways through the rocks, cross the road leading to overflow parking, and look for a tall, permanent cairn marked \"Wild Goose Trail.\" Follow this well-maintained but steep trail down to the Austin Pass/Heather Meadows parking lot. As you descend, pause to admire Bagley Lakes below and look across to see the Chain Lakes trail cutting across the hillside, between Table Mountain (left) and Mount Herman (right) up to Herman Saddle.Once you arrive at Austin Pass, walk down and left across the parking lot. Note that there is another privy here for the well-hydrated. To continue your hike, look for a gap in the low stone wall next to an interpretive sign. Walk through the gap and look for a trail down through the flat rocks--do not follow the paved path to the left as it leads to a dead-end view point overlook. Once through the flat rocks, the trail descends gently to the left toward the larger of the two Bagley Lakes. When you get to the stone bridge, you can head right to do a loop around the smaller, more northerly Bagley Lake. Looping around the lake adds a mile to your hike; to avoid this detour, cross the bridge and go left along the shore of the larger lake and up to Herman Saddle.On the way up, rest and look over your shoulder. 9,131 foot Mount Shuksan dominates the horizon behind you in all her glory. One of the most photographed mountains in the world, Shuksan is a Lummi word (spelled \"šéqsən\") meaning High Peak. Cresting Herman Saddle brings you to the high point of the hike at around 5,400 feet where views extend in every direction. 10,781 foot Mount Baker now dominates the horizon ahead and will remain there for most of the rest of the loop. Rounding out the vista are Table Mountain, Mounts Shuksan and Herman, as well as the rest of the pointy North Cascades lineup while lakes, valleys and meadows spread out below. It's not a bad spot to pause for a snack and congratulate yourself on the good life choices that got you here.Once you're ready to continue, drop down the other side of Herman Saddle, where Iceberg Lake comes into view. Continue through idyllic grassy meadows, heather and blueberry bushes until Hayes Lake appears on the right. When you've almost passed Hayes Lake, the trail forks into three paths. The main trail continues straight and to the left, while a small foot path leads sharply left to a pit toilet overlooking Iceberg Lake. This is marked with a small wooden sign pointing in that direction and marked \"toilet\". If you have swimming or a lakeside rest in mind, follow the trail off to the right along the shore of Hayes Lake with various access points to rocky beaches as well as campsites.Back on the main trail, proceed a short way to Iceberg Lake on the left, with plenty of access to its beaches as well. The trail continues on to the paired Mazama Lakes with a few campsites on the opposite shore. Once past these last two lakes, what was lost in the beginning of the hike must be gained. Climb back out of the lake basin. It's a milder ascent than the one to Herman Saddle, and Mount Baker keeps you company all the while. At the crest, you are again surrounded by views; Mount Shuksan rejoins the party and Mount Baker seems closer than ever.From here, the Ptarmigan Ridge trail heads up to the right, and the Chain Lakes trail veers left to close the loop back to Artist Point. This last 1.2 mile stretch is mostly flat but incredibly scenic, with Mount Shuksan ahead, Mount Baker behind, the Swift Creek and Rainbow valleys below, and even a glimpse of Baker Lake off in the distance. Watch and listen for marmots in the rocks below as you soak up the last of the views.ALTERNATE ROUTEFor those who'd rather climb first than descend the steep Wild Goose section, the loop starts at Austin Pass/Heather Meadows. The Wild Goose trail is well-marked and easy to find from the upper, southwest of the parking lot just off of Hwy 542. Big cairns mark the trail on both sides of the one road crossing at the overflow parking just below Artist Point. Once you arrive at the big Artist Point parking lot, walk straight across it and rejoin the well-signed \"Chain Lakes\" trail below Table Mountain rising to the right. In 0.2 miles, continue on past the junction where the Table Mountain trail heads off to the right.Admire big, showy Mount Baker ahead of you for this mostly flat mile with the Swift Creek and Rainbow valleys stretching out below and Mount Shuksan behind you. Around 5200 feet, there is a rocky outcrop with views of Mounts Baker and Shuksan. Arrive at a junction with the Ptarmigan Ridge trail; your route veers right and descends to the lakes.From here the trail is obvious and easy to follow, leading first to the paired Mazama Lakes, past Iceberg Lake on the right, and on to Hayes Lake ahead. At Hayes, a side trail on the left offers beach access, or you can stick to the main trail, admiring Hayes from above.From Hayes, the trail climbs up to the high point at Herman Saddle. Glance back occasionally for views of Mount Baker with Iceberg Lake below. At Herman Saddle--around 5400 feet--enjoy big views in every direction before beginning the long descent down to Bagley Lakes. The reward of hiking this route is the lake, where you can dip your feet (or as much of yourself as you'd like) in the blissfully cool water. At the stone bridge, add an easy, flat mile to the hike by continuing on around the smaller, northern Bagley Lake, or cross the bridge and make the short ascent back up to the parking lot at Austin Pass. When your legs protest this little climb, give a thought to the folks who parked at Artist Point and chose to go clockwise. Sometimes it's nice to remember that things could be worse.WTA Pro Tip: Carry sandals or water shoes if you'd like to go swimming or just dip your feet into the lakes; the shores are rocky. On the way home, consider stopping at the aptly named Beer Shrine (North Fork Brewery) in Deming where the food and beverages (including root beer on tap) are done right and make for a fitting end to a good day in the mountains.","driving_directions":"For Loop Option 1, starting at Artist Point, drive east from Bellingham on the Mount Baker Highway (542) for 34 miles to the Glacier Public Service Center.

Sumas Mountain is full of it from the old mining days and this hike is the best example.  An old \"gold\" mine safe door stands open, an decaying ore car and a slowing filling in mine awaits you on this trail. The best time to do this hike is after it hasn't rained in awhile, otherwise expect mud, lots of it. Glacial till underlies the trail for the first section and hikers will get muddy! The trail eventually traverses above Gold Creek and Rankin Creek, where a broken sign may be nailed to a tree. This creek may be dry in summer. The trail parallels a property line fence for a little bit and then splits veers to the right into the trees. One past Rankin Creek, the trail traverses the edge of a new clearcut. Watch for a signed trail to the left delineating \"The Cabin\".Descend this trail to complete a loop hike, but if hiker stay right, they will see a boot-beaten track that descends about 300 yards beyond the Cabin Trail junction. This drops down to a man-made wall of boulders near Gold Creek. The two 10-foot-high walls come together to make an corner, described as ‘the hotel site’ or the ‘stamp mill site’.The cabin is a short distance but will take you away from the main hike. The cabin does have a nice little map of the area which is worth checking out.Continue on for a few minutes and then keep your eyes out for a trail that veers off the main one, this will take you directly below to the \"safe\" and ore cart. Head back up on the trail and you will run into a creek and the old mine just behind it. The mine seems awfully small to begin with let alone the years of sediment and water filling it in now.If you proceed farther up the trail you can go off to Lost Lake and up a bit higher for view of the area.

From the trailhead, it's a short descent to a bridge over Ruby Creek. Take time to note the history here -- this was the scene of a gold rush in the 1880s, and this spot was overrun with claims. Look around for signs of these activities, or interpretive plaques near the bridge. Cross the bridge, and come to a junction with the Canyon Creek Trail. Here make a left to stay on the East Bank Trail. Continue on for 2.8 miles to a second trail junction. The trail heere leads to Ross Lake and several campsites, which you will need permits for. Be sure to have your permit before you begin your hike. However, if you're not stopping here, stay on the main trail, which heads north, climbing moderately through Hidden Hand Pass. From Hidden Hand Pass, the trail leads downhill through dense forest, ultimately reaching the shores of Ross Lake. This allows for plenty of swimming, fishing, and camping opportunties, both on the way to, and along the shoreline. Meandering along the lake, this trail guides families, stock trips, and new backpackers along an easy introductory hike. 16 miles in (only about halfway) the trail veers away from vivid-blue Ross Lake and follows Lightning Creek into a remote mountain valley. The valley trail soon begins switchbacking uphill, offering ever-improving views of Ross Lake before heading over a small notch and into a quiet valley. There's an old trapper's cabin here, kept up as a historic structure. As such, it's not available for public use, but stay a while and take photos of it, appreciating that once upon a time, people strove to make a living in this isolated place. Near the cabin is a log bridge -- crossing it leads to a junction for the Three Fools Creek Trail and another opportunity to disappear into the Pasayten Wilderness. Staying onthe East Bank Ross Lake trail, hikers will pass Willow Lake, heading on to Hozomeen Lake.

While the trail is not hard to follow, it is smart to travel with a map. Find the trailhead by snowshoeing 300 yards up the summer access road. Look for a winter sign in box and be sure to sign in. This is not only for your own safety, but so the Forest Service can monitor usage and will continue to plow the parking area. From the trailhead, your route takes you through a lowland forest, ponderosa pines and big leaf maples, climbing easily and relatively quickly to a small “waterfall” fed from springs that create Fall Creek. There is one spot where a spring runs all winter down the trail and melts the snow for about 30 feet, depending on snow depth the snowshoe trail may parallel this spot or tromp up thru the slush.From the waterfall, there are excellent views of Lake Wenatchee.This is an excellent outing for kids who are a more advanced hikers, or want to challenge themselves on snowshoes. Experienced, strong snowshoers frequently tackle the full climb to the top, but this is a far more challenging undertaking. If you have strong legs, a good understanding of the weather forecast, snow conditions and navigation, it may be a good jaunt for you, but remember, the top of Dirty Face is at 6000 feet, and much of the trail passes through a former burn, which can be dangerous in high winds.WTA Pro Tip: Always check the Northwest Avalanche Center website for conditions before any snowshoe adventure.","driving_directions":"From Stevens Pass, continue east on Highway 2, approximately 20 miles to Coles Corner.

Look no further than Franklin Falls! At just 2 miles roundtrip with 400 feet in elevation gain it is the perfect destination for any hiker looking for something easy and beautiful.WTA has done trail work here for the last ten years, building walls and rocks steps and constructing bridges to make this trail as safe as possible for even the smallest of hikers. There are a few spots where bits of the trail have been washed out, or handrails haven’t been installed, but overall you can feel confident in bringing your youngsters here for a safe and fun day on the trail. The trail includes a number of stairs with a very gentle incline that is easily hiked. As you hike, you'll be enshrouded in a thick canopy of coniferous trees which makes it a great trail to do on a hot day. At .7 miles in, the trail draws parallel to National Forest Road 58 for a short time. Just .3 miles further along, you reach picturesque Franklin Falls. The falls are situated between two tall viaducts that allow traffic along I-90 to pass year-round without interference from avalanches in winter. The falls are actually comprised of three separate tiers, giving them a total drop of 135 feet. However, only the last and largest drop can be seen from the trail. At 70 feet, Franklin Falls is a spectacular sight to see, with its best flows between April and July. There is a viewpoint before reaching the falls but hikers can get closer by following a narrow trail gouged into the side of the rock. Use caution and keep children close as the rocks are often wet and potentially slippery. The falls, when running at peak, give off a pretty heavy spray so rain gear is a good idea if you want to get close. During lower flow periods there is more room to roam by the base of the falls. In the wintertime this also makes an excellent destination for an easy snowshoe, though hikers are well-advised to not venture to the splash pool in icy conditions. The falls run year round and the incredible icicle formations along the rock face around the falls are spectacular--well worth the trip. There is a large parking area past the bridge that marks the trailhead for Franklin Falls that can hold 30 cars. If that one is full, head up to the larger parking lot, a half mile past the bridge and trailhead, where there is more parking available. There are no garbage receptacles at the trailhead so be sure to pack it out!WTA Pro Tip: Arrive early to ensure a parking spot and enjoy the trail before it becomes too crowded.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 47 Denny Creek/Tinkham Road.

Thanks to the handiwork of various groups in the outdoor community, hikers can now reach Rattlesnake Mountain from the west, starting from a trailhead at Snoqualmie Point.Expect fewer hikers on this approach, and enjoy fantastic views out over the Snoqualmie Valley, Mount Si, Mount Teneriffe, North Bend and more. Hike to one of the pleasant viewpoints along the way, to Rattlesnake Mountain, or do a traverse all the way to Rattlesnake Lake, clocking in at 10.2 miles. The views are some of the best in the Cascade foothills and the trail can be hiked year-round, though it can be snowy in winter.The trail was officially dedicated in June 2007, though people had hiked this route using a mix of trail and logging roads for years before. Now the trail winds its way through mostly second-growth forest, crossing a few logging roads and requiring just a few stints on old roads. The trail follows I-90 fairly closely, but there are times you don't remember it's just out of sight. Still, the reality of being in a managed forest does appear as some sections wend through clearcuts. Fortunately, the forest canopy gets more mature towards the higher points, and there is a delightful progression of ecosystems along the way.The first nice viewpoint is Stan's Overlook, about 2.5 miles in. Pass under some powerlines and continue gradually upward another third of a mile to an obvious signed trail to the left. Stan's Overlook has a picnic table and two benches. From there you can see Mount Si and the Snoqualmie Valley. Next up, and a fine turn-around for those not traveling end-to-end, is Grand Prospect about 4.9 miles from your starting point. This precipice is due south of the town of North Bend.Six miles from the trailhead and 3500 feet high is East Peak, featuring great views, including Rainier on a good day. Then it is downhill two miles to the Ledges and, 2.5 miles further, Rattlesnake Lake.This trail system is the result of thousands of hours of hard work by trail crews from  Washington Conservation Corps, EarthCorps, and Washington Trails Association (WTA's handiwork was up to the Ledges from Rattlesnake Lake), all jointly managed by the Mountains-to-Sound-Greenway and DNR.

A trail runner in need of a place to train when you can’t make it to the mountains? A dog owner looking for a place to walk with your furry friend? A parent hoping to introduce a child to the wonderful outdoors? Or maybe just a busy urban dweller searching for a quick escape from the hustle and bustle of city life? If you fit any of these descriptions, then look no further. Seward Park is the place for you!Located southeast from downtown Seattle, Seward Park resides on the Bailey Peninsula in the neighborhood that shares its name. The city of Seattle bought the peninsula in 1911 and began developing the area into a park shortly thereafter. Since then, the park has become home to a variety of educational, recreational, and cultural activities. Visitors can enjoy a 2.4 mile bike and walking loop, an amphitheater, a native plant garden, an art studio, sheltered picnic areas, slightly more challenging hiking trails, a swimming beach, and more.To start your urban adventure, begin at the Seward Park Environmental & Audubon Center. Here you’ll find restrooms, waste bags to clean up after your dog, an information kiosk with facts about the park’s plant and animal life, and knowledgeable staff members who can help you make the most of your visit. Next, head southeast from the Audubon Center toward the children’s playground to find the start of the outer bike and walking path that hugs the shoreline surrounding to park for 2.4 miles, labeled as trail #10 on the park map. This trail is paved the entire way around and can be enjoyed by people of all fitness levels and abilities. As you begin walking along the path, take note of the poison oak signs. Stay on the path or trails to avoid an itchy encounter. You’ll also notice lots of benches throughout the park to take a rest or to simply gaze out at beautiful Lake Washington. At a little over half a mile you will come to a junction with another intersecting trail, trail #2. If you’d like to cut the longer loop of the park short, make a left at this junction to cut across the park, otherwise continue straight. Shortly after this junction you will come across the site of the Seward Park Fish Hatchery built in 1935. Although the hatchery has been closed for some time, remnants of it can still be seen. Make sure to stop at the nearby information kiosk to read about its history.Continuing on, you will come to another junction at approximately 1.75 miles. From here, you can leave the paved path and head into the interior of the park, where you will find slightly more rugged, wooded trails. These trails are ideal for those looking for a challenge and a detour from the more popular outer loop; however, be mindful of roots, logs and rocks that could present an obstacle for some. The interior dirt and gravel paths are all interconnecting and no more than a mile each.After a side trip through the forest, return to the paved trail and continue heading west back toward the Seward Park Environmental & Audubon Center. You’ll encounter outstanding views of downtown Seattle, a friendly reminder that you barely have to leave the city to find an outdoor haven.  WTA Pro Tip: After working up an appetite at the park, consider stopping for lunch at the nearby Flying Squirrel Pizza Co. which features locally made ingredients including meats from Zoe's Meats, Salumi Artisan Cured Meats, and Draper Farms, locally farmed vegetables, coffee from Stumptown Coffee Roasters, and ice cream from Snoqualmie Ice Cream. Flying Squirrel has been serving up delicious pizza to the community since 2008.","driving_directions":"By bus: The Route 50 stops at Seward Park a few stops before its terminus at Othello Station.

This historic 316-acre state park, nestled in the midst of the Seattle metropolitan area, has playground facilities for children, picnic areas, trails for mountain bikers, and fields for sports teams as well.Boats may be launched at the Department of Fish and Wildlife ramp in Kenmore, just north of Saint Edward State Park. The Park offers a big toy playground for children, numerous picnic tables (though the park encourages reservations for picnics), ball fields for baseball and other sports, mountain bike trails, and even a dining hall that can be reserved. Perhaps the most fascinating activity—and why you’re reading this guide description—is hiking from the hills 400 feet above Lake Washington down to the undeveloped shoreline under a dense canopy of Douglas fir, western red cedar, western hemlock, bigleaf maple, Pacific madrona, and cottonwood. Wildflowers and ground cover include sword ferns, devil’s club, candy flower, thimbleberry, red currant, Robert Geranium, Oregon grape, and bleeding heart. Be cautious of the Pacific banana slugs and European black slugs that outnumber hikers on the trail during the spring, summer, and fall months.There are many routes you can take. Some are shared with mountain bikers. For a direct hike to the lakeshore, find the Perimeter/Seminary trailhead (the widest trail) to the west of the seminary building. This route descends 360 feet over 0.62 miles to a small beach and the junction with the 0.57-mile Beach Trail, which takes off northward along the undeveloped shoreline. The beach is well-suited to wading or contemplation. Fishing is allowed with a permit from the state. There are several routes back up the hill, including the Grotto Trail (0.4 miles)—the steepest choice, the South Canyon Trail (0.9 miles)—with perhaps the most stunning forest canopy, and the South Ridge Trail/Water Tower Trail combination (1.1 miles)—which skirts the Bastyr campus. For those who desire a longer sylvan experience, find the trailheads east of the building complex near Seminary Drive to access the North Trail (1.4 miles), which becomes the Beach Trail when it nears the lake. The longest possible loop is just over 3 miles.Consider printing a map to help choose the route that best suits you and to avoid getting lost.History of the area: The Seattle Catholic Archdiocese purchased the property that is now Saint Edward State Park to build a seminary for the Sulpician Order. The area had been logged in the 19th century and again in the 1920s. The seminary was completed in 1931 and named for Edward the Confessor, king of England in the 11th Century. The seminary closed in 1977, and the Archdiocese sold 316 acres to the state of Washington for use as a park. The park opened in 1978. Subsequently the Archdiocese sold the remaining acreage to Bastyr University, which is surrounded by the Park’s grounds. In 2007 the seminary was placed on the National Historic Register.","driving_directions":"Take Lake City Way/WA-522 to 68th Street.

The cost? The first three miles of the trail is easy, but the last half-mile to the summit is steep and occasionally brushy. Taking a break on that climb is no hardship though: the hillside is carpeted in berries and the views start early.Start at the Smithbrook trailhead, an area brushy with neck-high fireweed. Proceed through the brush on a moderate grade and quickly arrive at a more open trail through a nice forest. Pass a rocky area with giant boulders as you ascend up moderately graded switchbacks. At 1.5 miles, arrive at a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail. If you go in September, bring some fresh fruit to share with the thru-hikers bound for Canada -- you'll see quite a few from here on out.Head left (southbound) on the PCT, enjoying a relatively flat section of trail.  The open forest provides periodic views of the rocky wall on the opposite side of the valley. This is a great place to teach young children the joy of hiking. The trail is lined with blueberries and huckleberries–the perfect fuel for going just a little further.  Approximately three miles from the trailhead, just before dropping to Lake Valhalla, you’ll find a turn-off for Mt. McCausland on your right. The trail is unmarked, but an obvious switchback heads up the hillside. You’ll quickly arrive in a meadow of low blueberry and huckleberry bushes. The sudden increase in the quantity of berries should give you an idea of the relative popularity of Mount McCausland versus Lake Valhalla and the PCT below you.The switchbacks shorten and then disappear entirely as the trail charges straight up the mountain. Bring hiking poles; there are some big steps here and the trail surface is a little loose. Views of Lake Valhalla and Lichtenberg Mountain start right away, and you can still enjoy views from this trail even if you decide that attaining the summit is not part of your hiking agenda. Making it to the summit will grant additional views northeast of layers of mountains and tiny Dow Lake.It is possible to access Mount McCausland from Steven's Pass, which saves you some miles driving, but adds on miles hiking. If you choose to access this mountain this way, you'll have a 12.6 mile roundtrip hike, and you will need a Northwest Forest Pass.  WTA Pro Tip: Save your energy, if possible, and when you’re done with Mount McCausland, head down to Lake Valhalla. It’s only half a mile from the junction and there is a nice sandy beach to relax on.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take Hwy 2 east. Four miles after the pass, the highway divides.

Hike down a lushly forested ravine with a babbling creek, home to many species of salmon and trout.  Follow the creek to its estuary as it empties into Puget Sound. If you extend your hike to the beach, breathe in the serene panorama of Brown’s Bay, Puget Sound, the islands, and the Olympic Mountains. Watch the seabirds and go beachcombing to look for crabshells, anemones, and other treasures.  Take the broad trail from the trailhead at the parking lot down past the small lawn and enter open alder forest with salmonberry understory, then mature Douglas fir forest. The wide dirt trail can easily handle the traffic for this popular trail. Soon, it starts to descend sharply, losing almost 400 ft of elevation in 0.5 miles. This part of the trail is a bit rocky, rutted, and can be slippery, but the descent is facilitated by a somewhat eroded log staircase built into the hillside. Despite this park’s location in the city of Lynnwood , it is an oasis of native forest vegetation – only closer to the beach do you see some ivy and other invasives.At the bottom of the staircase you start hearing Lund’s Gulch Creek. It is named after John Lund who homesteaded here in 1878. Enjoy looking at the play of the water over the rocks. Very soon, you pass the 0.5 mile sign.  The trail levels out and follows closely along the creek. Forest is now open mixed forest with Bigleaf maple, Western red cedar, Sitka spruce, and a salmonberry understory. Note the impressive stumps of old growth Western red cedar that were left from logging, with the lumberjacks’ springboard notches still showing. Closer to the beach, the forest becomes alder forest with fern understory.  At 1 mile you reach a fork in the trail. Go left over the bridge and take a peek into the stream below to see if you can see any fish. Salmon come to spawn in the fall, and Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, steelhead, cutthroat trout, and sculpin have been observed in this stream. Then walk on past the Ranger station to a field with a covered picnic area, volleyball field and privy. Enjoy the first views of the Olympic mountains whose tops are visible even above the elevated railroad tracks at the end of the field. When you get to the far end of the field, you will see a tunnel passing under the railroad, permitting Lund’s Gulch Creek to empty into Puget Sound. In seasons when the creek level is low enough, you now have 2 options: either go through the tunnel to the beach (see: Extending your hike), or cross the creek here to the trail on the other side, which allows you to loop back through forest to the fork at the 1 mile point and continue on straight to return to the trailhead for a total 2.5 mile round-trip hike.  If the creek is too high for either of these options, then once you get to the creek and have peeked through the tunnel, you would retrace your steps back to the trailhead.  There was previously a metal grate all the way across the creek through the tunnel, which allowed people to walk to the beach at all times.  However, sediment deposition and changes in the estuary have changed the water level under the tunnel.  The grate had to be removed to allow salmonids to continue to swim into Lund’s Gulch Creek.  It will be some time before easy year-round access to the beach will be restored, as planning and permitting is complex in this critical and dynamic habitat.Extending your hikeIf the water level in the creek is low enough, you can pass under the tunnel to extend your hike along the beach.  There are two ways to do this. (1) If the concrete ledge on the left, about a foot wide, is above the water level, you can walk through along the ledge and then along some logs until you reach the beach. (2) You can wade through the water to reach the beach – some people go barefoot, some people bring their own waders, and some people borrow waders from the Ranger.Once you are on the beach, enjoy sitting on the logs taking in the views.  Looking northwest across Puget Sound, you can see the white bluffs of the southern tip of Whidbey Island. Looking southwest, you see the green Kitsap Peninsula, and through the strait between Kitsap and Whidbey Island, the landmass of the Olympic Peninsula forms a sliver on the horizon. To the south are the headlands that define the southern end of Brown’s Bay. The Olympic Mountains tower over the landscape to the west. Watch for ferries smoothly gliding across Puget Sound in their inimitable way. You may also see a train passing, always an exciting sight. Then look more closely at Lund’s Gulch Creek and how it winds through its small estuary, which is changing shape over the years, depending on the interplay between the tides, water flow variations from the creek, and sediment deposition. Watch for heron and osprey using their very different feeding strategies to benefit from the Sound’s bounty.At low tide, you may be able to walk as far south as the disused Haines Wharf, which adds about 1 mile round-trip to the hike.  At very low tides, it may also be possible to walk north as far as Sunset Wharf, which adds 0.7 mile roundtrip. Be careful, though, to monitor the tide.  Look at the level of the marine vegetation and barnacles on the exposed rocks as signs of the high tide level. Determine whether you would be able to return safely if the tide returned, without walking on the rail embankment, which is unsafe and not permitted. If you are lucky enough to be there at low tide, beachcombing is a treat – don’t miss seeing the purple sea anemones hiding at the base of big rocks on the landward side.WTA Pro TipDo not cross the railroad tracks. You would be endangering yourself and others, and would also risk fines levied by BNSF police, for illegal trespassing on private property.","driving_directions":"From I-5, take exit 183 to 164th St SW, going west for about 1.3 miles.
