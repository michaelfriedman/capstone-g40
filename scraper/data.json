Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 85 for East Cle Elum.

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive I-90 to exit 32. Turn left onto 436th Ave SE. Follow 436th to its end at SE North Bend Way. Turn left.

The 25-foot falls are the final waterfall along Cherry Creek. The falls drop over a wide, rocky ledge into a large pool. This pool is inviting to hikers, but as always with waterfalls, be careful when splashing and playing in rocky areas. Cherry Creek flows well all year long, but by autumn the left-hand side of the falls usually dries up.To find the unmarked trail head entrance, look directly behind the road sign marking the junction of Kelly Road and Moutain View Road.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north. You will pass a fast food restaurant and a service station. If you have any thoughts of using a restroom these will be your only options until you get back to town. There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries! The sign for the left branch adds \"Next 24 Miles,\" and that's your route.The pavement soon ends, and you will have a 20-mile drive on rough roads that often have potholes and may be dusty. Take your time and accept the situation. The route isn't very scenic: you'll just be passing a lot of logged-over areas. About 17 miles from the Y, turn left and cross a bridge over Lennox Creek. Then turn right onto Forest Road 57, where the \"57\" sometimes is obscured by vegetation. (Remember this intersection for your return when you will go left here, cross the bridge, then go right onto North Fork Road.)On Road 57, it's another 3.2 miles to the Bare Mountain Trailhead. It will be on your left at an elevation of 2,100 feet. Parking is available in a wide area on the right side of the road or along the shoulder. There is room for perhaps six or seven cars, plus two more on the left at the trailhead itself. There are no facilities here. Display your Northwest Forest Pass in your car. Then fill out one of the Wilderness Use Permit forms available at the trailhead and deposit the bottom half in the box. These forms are used to estimate trail usage and that, in turn, impacts funding for trail maintenance.

As hikers, we get to see their efforts up close. Snow Mountain Ranch offers a variety of summer and winter walks on 9.2 miles of trails. Relics of the old cattle ranch still remind hikers of the past on this 1,800-acre property. The ranch was home to Elon and Joan Gilbert, friends of Justice William O. Douglas, whom he would often stop to visit on his way into the Cascades from his home in Yakima. History is just one of many attractions at Snow Mountain Ranch. Hike the riparian areas for a chance to glimpse great horned owls, or focus your binoculars on the local pond for sightings of a variety of ducks. The lowland fields provide excellent hunting grounds for red-tailed hawks, sharp shinned hawks and northern harriers. There is also a resident population of elk that wander in and out of ranch area. Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail. This trail climbs 1 mile south along the benchlands above the ravine to a junction with the Bench Loop Trail and a connection with the west leg of the Cowiche Mountain Loop Trail. Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch. Once on the summit, kick back, bask in the sun and enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.

The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Note that this stretch of the trail is prime snake terrain, so be cautious. At about 0.3 mile the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a small loop. We went left. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.But as the trail climbs, the scenery just gets better. Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia. Elsewhere, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow aster-like beauties, and microsensis painted the terrain. And oh! the bitterroot—when the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink.The memorial site (which can be seen from all along the trail) offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley as well as the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 101 (Thorp) and after exiting, turn right.

Its a great hike for people who arrive at the park by boat or for anyone wanting to make a longer hike of the 1.0 mile Beacon Rock Trail.The trail begins at the Woodard Creek Rail trestle just a 100 yards north of the Moorage. A short bridge designed to be removed when the creek runs high begins the route. After climbing quickly through a switchback and series of climbing turns the trail winds more gently to Ridell Lake (which is better described as a wetland on its way to becoming a meadow).Curving around the wetland hikers get a nice view of the Rock before heading into the trees again for another climb to Hwy 14 where the route ends opposite the park headquarters. To reach the start of the Beacon Rock Trail, turn left to head east for 100 yards.The main purpose for the trail is to provide a safe passage for visitors who arrive by boat and wish to hike the Rock. But It is also a great way to extend a visit to the park by combining a picnic at Doetsch Ranch picnic area with a hike up to the Rock and back.If you forgot to bring a lunch, the Beacon Rock Cafe nestled in the Skamania General Store has excellent burgers, breakfasts and is a surprising find for those who don't expect much from a roadside general store.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail. Switchback down hillsides and through lush green forest, until you arrive at the beautiful falls and the Big Bridge.","driving_directions":"To reach the main trailhead, drive east on I-90 to exit 34 (about 31 miles from Seattle).

To reach the Homestead Valley Trailhead, head exit 38 on I-90. From the exit ramp, turn right onto SE Homestead Valley Road. Cross over the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River and take the first right. At the first and second forks, bear left.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW.

Access to the south district of the huts, managed by Mount Tahoma Trails Association, is via a series of steep forest roads. Climbing almost the entire way, the trek can be tiring, but don’t let this discourage you. The views are well worth it. If you're snowshoeing, make sure to practice good trail manners and stay to the right side of the road, out of the ski tracks. From the lower Sno-Park trailhead, start up the road, continuing straight through the first junction in under a half mile. Pass the middle parking area at 1.2 miles and the upper park at 1.9 miles. After passing over Catt Creek, you’ll come to a string of switchbacks. Keep straight at the junction, then reach a low saddle at 2.6 miles. Here, the road veers right, where you can continue up to High Hut -- closer, but a steeper hike. Turning left, you'll enjoy a somewhat flatter grade for a short while. Look for peek-a-boo views of Mount Rainier to your left, until the trail begins climbing again. You'll have another 0.8 miles of steep uphill before this section peaks beneath a banner of prayer flags strung up across the trail. From this colorful indicator, continue on through more forest on a flat grade that begins descending downhill to a junction with the road leading to The Yurt -- the furthest flung hut on the system.

Though they've scaled many an international peak, many of them practiced their chops on this fairly diminutive, but close-to-town leg-burner. There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath. For those who are interested and have a good map there are numerous alternative trails that return to I-90 and exit 20. For the patient and observant, there is the opportunity to view wildlife along these routes. This author has personally seen owls, deer, and a bear.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, take I-90 east to exit 20 for High Point Way.

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930’s and then as a ski area until the 1970’s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -– a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier. Bring a GPS device or download compass bearings from the park website as a backup. Such contingencies show that the dividing line between day-hiking and alpine conditions is blurred here, yet another way this hike takes you into truly rarefied air, more than halfway up the tallest peak in Washington.","driving_directions":"From the west, drive Highway 706 (National Park Highway) to the Nisqually Entrance to Mount Rainier National Park.

There is considerable elevation gain and loss -- about 16,000 feet! Some places are impassable until well into August when the snow melts out. And the distance requires hikers to carry six or seven days of food and arrange for a car shuttle or pick-up at Stevens Pass. It is best for hikers of this segment to pick up a map from the Pacific Crest Trail Association (www.pcta.org) and buy the Pacific Crest Trail Oregon & Washington guidebook by Jeffrey Schaffer and Andy Selters published by Wilderness Press.Note that the mileage for this hike entry is for a thru-hike from Snoqualmie Pass to Stevens, not a roundtrip hike.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive I-90 to exit 52 (signed for Snoqualmie Pass west).

Although you can't see the lake through all the trees, there are other sights and sounds to enjoy along this route. Most notably the vibrant greens of the understory in spring, beautiful fall yellows and quite a few species of birds nearly all year.To reach the trail from Vancouver Lake Regional Park, walk north past the large group picnic areas on a gravel road. The road enters the forest and continues for about 700 feet before turning west. Find the footpath right at this bend in the road.From there it is about one mile through the forest before the trail ends at a dirt \"road\". A new bridge to the west crosses Buckmire Slough providing foot and bicycle access to the 501 spur near its dead end.The entire length of this trail was built by volunteers from Washington Trails Association and Clark County. Construction was completed on February 18th, 2016. You can also take the nearby Frenchman's Bar trail from the parking lot across the way to Frenchman's Bar Regional Park. The wide, paved path provides the perfect urban getaway for hikers and dog walkers alike—it’s also a favorite among birders. On clear days, you’ll be treated to views of Mount Hood, Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens.As the trail proceeds past Vancouver Lake to Frenchman’s Bar Regional Park, it traverses the shore of the Columbia River, with views across the way to Sauvie Island and the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, just north of Kelly Point Park. With unhindered views of the Columbia River, open sandy beaches and mountain vistas, there’s plenty of room to stretch out in this southwest Washington backyard.While dogs are permitted on the trail year-round, they are not permitted on the beach or surrounding turf area of Vancouver Lake Regional Park between April 1 and Oct. 31.WTA volunteers completed construction of this trail in spring of 2016. The project was the culmination of several years of planning and multiple years of construction with partners including the Chinook Trail Association, AmeriCorps volunteers from the National Civilian Community Corps. The County helped to pay for construction materials with funds the Parks Foundation of Clark County through a grant sponsored by the Dorothy Langsdorf Trail Fund and the Langsdorf Family.","driving_directions":"Vancouver Lake is just west of Vancouver.

Though they've scaled many an international peak, many of them practiced their chops on this fairly diminutive, but close-to-town leg-burner. There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath. For those who are interested and have a good map there are numerous alternative trails that return to I-90 and exit 20. For the patient and observant, there is the opportunity to view wildlife along these routes. This author has personally seen owls, deer, and a bear.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, take I-90 east to exit 20 for High Point Way.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Note that this stretch of the trail is prime snake terrain, so be cautious. At about 0.3 mile the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a small loop. We went left. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.But as the trail climbs, the scenery just gets better. Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia. Elsewhere, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow aster-like beauties, and microsensis painted the terrain. And oh! the bitterroot—when the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink.The memorial site (which can be seen from all along the trail) offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley as well as the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 101 (Thorp) and after exiting, turn right.

From the boat landing, hikers and campers pile onto a bus that climbs up steep switchbacks (hang on and close your eyes) to Holden Village, a Lutheran summer camp. The scene is a bit surreal for backpackers, but the summer campers are obviously having a great time.From Holden Village start hiking along dirt road past the ruins of the old mining town. After a mile there is the Holden camping area and you enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Here the road becomes a trail through a rather uniform forest. Bugs can be severe in mid-summer. After another 3.9 miles of gently ascending, well maintained trail you reach Hart Lake. There is no convenient camping between the Holden camp and Hart Lake. There is pleasant camping at the west end of cool, deep Hart Lake.The trail sticks to the valley floor for the next mile with several high waterfalls in view. There is reasonable camping at Rebel Camp. The trail then gradually switchbacks up the North side of the valley. This section of trail is quite brushy and dusty, but has nice views of Hart Lake, and blueberries in season.Shallow, emerald green Lower Lyman Lake comes into view 3.2 miles beyond Rebel Camp. The more scenic campsites are on the west side of the camping area. Continue around the lake, up and up to Upper Lyman Lakes, icy and blue under Chiwawa Mountain and the Lyman Glacier, with views up to Spider Gap. Scramblers can pass through the gap to Spider Meadows.Another option from Lower Lyman is to hike 1.5 miles to Cloudy Pass for flower-strewn meadows and great views, including Sitting Bull Mountain and Needle Peak.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930’s and then as a ski area until the 1970’s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -– a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier. Bring a GPS device or download compass bearings from the park website as a backup. Such contingencies show that the dividing line between day-hiking and alpine conditions is blurred here, yet another way this hike takes you into truly rarefied air, more than halfway up the tallest peak in Washington.","driving_directions":"From the west, drive Highway 706 (National Park Highway) to the Nisqually Entrance to Mount Rainier National Park.

In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail. This trail climbs 1 mile south along the benchlands above the ravine to a junction with the Bench Loop Trail and a connection with the west leg of the Cowiche Mountain Loop Trail. Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch. Once on the summit, kick back, bask in the sun and enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. When it’s time to return, descend the way you came or make it a loop by descending on the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail.","driving_directions":"From SR 12 on the north side of Yakima, exit at 40th Avenue and proceed 1.5 miles south to Summitview Avenue.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north. You will pass a fast food restaurant and a service station. If you have any thoughts of using a restroom these will be your only options until you get back to town. There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries! The sign for the left branch adds \"Next 24 Miles,\" and that's your route.The pavement soon ends, and you will have a 20-mile drive on rough roads that often have potholes and may be dusty. Take your time and accept the situation. The route isn't very scenic: you'll just be passing a lot of logged-over areas. About 17 miles from the Y, turn left and cross a bridge over Lennox Creek. Then turn right onto Forest Road 57, where the \"57\" sometimes is obscured by vegetation. (Remember this intersection for your return when you will go left here, cross the bridge, then go right onto North Fork Road.)On Road 57, it's another 3.2 miles to the Bare Mountain Trailhead. It will be on your left at an elevation of 2,100 feet. Parking is available in a wide area on the right side of the road or along the shoulder. There is room for perhaps six or seven cars, plus two more on the left at the trailhead itself. There are no facilities here. Display your Northwest Forest Pass in your car. Then fill out one of the Wilderness Use Permit forms available at the trailhead and deposit the bottom half in the box. These forms are used to estimate trail usage and that, in turn, impacts funding for trail maintenance. So it is important.","distance":"8.6 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.6395","longitude":"-121.5283","elevation_gain":"3300","highest_point":"5353"},{"region_image":"https://www.wta.org/southwest_washington.png","google_map":"www.google.com/maps/dir//45.7075,-122.6658/@45.7075,-122.6658,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/cover-shot-800x600.jpg/@@images/406d5d67-a732-4078-b776-d2605d9187b0.jpeg","region":"Southwest Washington","current_rating":"0.00 out of 5","name":"Salmon Creek Trail","trail_description":"Whether you’d like a peaceful break from everyday life or just some exercise, the Salmon Creek Trail is for you. This paved trail takes you through wetlands, around ponds, and across a natural habitat undergoing restoration. Within minutes you can leave city life behind and be immersed in picture-perfect scenery accompanied by the sound of birds. The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.  At 2.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction near a softball sports complex. This makes a good turnaround point unless you would like to use the restrooms on the east side of the fields.WTA Pro Tip: If you’d like a more wheelchair friendly walk, you can access the Salmon Creek Trail from Salmon Creek Park or the softball field parking lot, both off NE 117th Street.","driving_directions":"The trailhead is in Vancouver Washington, located in on NW 36th Avenue between the Felida Bridge and NW 138th Street.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. That short, somewhat obscure street is located behind the QFC Market visible from Holman Road N. Reach the entrance by turning north off Holman Road onto 3rd Ave NW, then turning left in one block onto NW 100th Place. The park entrance is two blocks west. The parking area has room for four or five cars, and one spot is signed for police use only. Additional parking is available along NW 100th Place. Metro bus Route 28 has stops (in both directions) along NW 100th Place in the block SW of the park entrance.

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 85 for East Cle Elum.

You'll climb steeply through classic Olympic forest, surrounded by red cedar and hemlock trees cloaked in moss. The switchbacks are constant, and there's not much for views on your way to the pass, but look closely at your surroundings and you'll be surprised at how many varieties of moss spring to life on the forest floor. The trail climbs steadily the whole way to Notch Pass - you'll gain 2000 feet of elevation in 2.1 miles.

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive I-90 to exit 32. Turn left onto 436th Ave SE. Follow 436th to its end at SE North Bend Way. Turn left.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail. Switchback down hillsides and through lush green forest, until you arrive at the beautiful falls and the Big Bridge.","driving_directions":"To reach the main trailhead, drive east on I-90 to exit 34 (about 31 miles from Seattle).

A new bridge to the west crosses Buckmire Slough providing foot and bicycle access to the 501 spur near its dead end.The entire length of this trail was built by volunteers from Washington Trails Association and Clark County. Construction was completed on February 18th, 2016. You can also take the nearby Frenchman's Bar trail from the parking lot across the way to Frenchman's Bar Regional Park. The wide, paved path provides the perfect urban getaway for hikers and dog walkers alike—it’s also a favorite among birders. On clear days, you’ll be treated to views of Mount Hood, Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens.As the trail proceeds past Vancouver Lake to Frenchman’s Bar Regional Park, it traverses the shore of the Columbia River, with views across the way to Sauvie Island and the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, just north of Kelly Point Park. With unhindered views of the Columbia River, open sandy beaches and mountain vistas, there’s plenty of room to stretch out in this southwest Washington backyard.While dogs are permitted on the trail year-round, they are not permitted on the beach or surrounding turf area of Vancouver Lake Regional Park between April 1 and Oct. 31.WTA volunteers completed construction of this trail in spring of 2016. The project was the culmination of several years of planning and multiple years of construction with partners including the Chinook Trail Association, AmeriCorps volunteers from the National Civilian Community Corps.

Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail.

It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These “cave holes” were formed when miner’s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. After a short set of stairs going down it’s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it’s heavily used and fills up quickly. The trailhead is equipped with two privies, garbage cans, a picnic table, historical interpretive signage, and doggie bag dispenser.","driving_directions":"From Seattle head east on I-90.

From the boat landing, hikers and campers pile onto a bus that climbs up steep switchbacks (hang on and close your eyes) to Holden Village, a Lutheran summer camp. The scene is a bit surreal for backpackers, but the summer campers are obviously having a great time.From Holden Village start hiking along dirt road past the ruins of the old mining town. After a mile there is the Holden camping area and you enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Here the road becomes a trail through a rather uniform forest. Bugs can be severe in mid-summer. After another 3.9 miles of gently ascending, well maintained trail you reach Hart Lake. There is no convenient camping between the Holden camp and Hart Lake. There is pleasant camping at the west end of cool, deep Hart Lake.The trail sticks to the valley floor for the next mile with several high waterfalls in view. There is reasonable camping at Rebel Camp. The trail then gradually switchbacks up the North side of the valley. This section of trail is quite brushy and dusty, but has nice views of Hart Lake, and blueberries in season.Shallow, emerald green Lower Lyman Lake comes into view 3.2 miles beyond Rebel Camp.

The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.

Most notably the vibrant greens of the understory in spring, beautiful fall yellows and quite a few species of birds nearly all year.To reach the trail from Vancouver Lake Regional Park, walk north past the large group picnic areas on a gravel road. The road enters the forest and continues for about 700 feet before turning west. Find the footpath right at this bend in the road.From there it is about one mile through the forest before the trail ends at a dirt \"road\". A new bridge to the west crosses Buckmire Slough providing foot and bicycle access to the 501 spur near its dead end.The entire length of this trail was built by volunteers from Washington Trails Association and Clark County. Construction was completed on February 18th, 2016. You can also take the nearby Frenchman's Bar trail from the parking lot across the way to Frenchman's Bar Regional Park. The wide, paved path provides the perfect urban getaway for hikers and dog walkers alike—it’s also a favorite among birders. On clear days, you’ll be treated to views of Mount Hood, Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens.As the trail proceeds past Vancouver Lake to Frenchman’s Bar Regional Park, it traverses the shore of the Columbia River, with views across the way to Sauvie Island and the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, just north of Kelly Point Park. With unhindered views of the Columbia River, open sandy beaches and mountain vistas, there’s plenty of room to stretch out in this southwest Washington backyard.While dogs are permitted on the trail year-round, they are not permitted on the beach or surrounding turf area of Vancouver Lake Regional Park between April 1 and Oct. 31.WTA volunteers completed construction of this trail in spring of 2016. The project was the culmination of several years of planning and multiple years of construction with partners including the Chinook Trail Association, AmeriCorps volunteers from the National Civilian Community Corps.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW.

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 85 for East Cle Elum.

Access to the south district of the huts, managed by Mount Tahoma Trails Association, is via a series of steep forest roads. Climbing almost the entire way, the trek can be tiring, but don’t let this discourage you. The views are well worth it.

As hikers, we get to see their efforts up close. Snow Mountain Ranch offers a variety of summer and winter walks on 9.2 miles of trails. Relics of the old cattle ranch still remind hikers of the past on this 1,800-acre property. The ranch was home to Elon and Joan Gilbert, friends of Justice William O. Douglas, whom he would often stop to visit on his way into the Cascades from his home in Yakima. History is just one of many attractions at Snow Mountain Ranch. Hike the riparian areas for a chance to glimpse great horned owls, or focus your binoculars on the local pond for sightings of a variety of ducks. The lowland fields provide excellent hunting grounds for red-tailed hawks, sharp shinned hawks and northern harriers. There is also a resident population of elk that wander in and out of ranch area. Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail.

Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch. Once on the summit, kick back, bask in the sun and enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully.

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive I-90 to exit 32. Turn left onto 436th Ave SE. Follow 436th to its end at SE North Bend Way. Turn left.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north. You will pass a fast food restaurant and a service station. If you have any thoughts of using a restroom these will be your only options until you get back to town. There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries! The sign for the left branch adds \"Next 24 Miles,\" and that's your route.The pavement soon ends, and you will have a 20-mile drive on rough roads that often have potholes and may be dusty. Take your time and accept the situation. The route isn't very scenic: you'll just be passing a lot of logged-over areas. About 17 miles from the Y, turn left and cross a bridge over Lennox Creek. Then turn right onto Forest Road 57, where the \"57\" sometimes is obscured by vegetation. (Remember this intersection for your return when you will go left here, cross the bridge, then go right onto North Fork Road.)On Road 57, it's another 3.2 miles to the Bare Mountain Trailhead. It will be on your left at an elevation of 2,100 feet. Parking is available in a wide area on the right side of the road or along the shoulder. There is room for perhaps six or seven cars, plus two more on the left at the trailhead itself. There are no facilities here. Display your Northwest Forest Pass in your car. Then fill out one of the Wilderness Use Permit forms available at the trailhead and deposit the bottom half in the box. These forms are used to estimate trail usage and that, in turn, impacts funding for trail maintenance.

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930’s and then as a ski area until the 1970’s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -– a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier. Bring a GPS device or download compass bearings from the park website as a backup.

Though they've scaled many an international peak, many of them practiced their chops on this fairly diminutive, but close-to-town leg-burner. There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath. For those who are interested and have a good map there are numerous alternative trails that return to I-90 and exit 20. For the patient and observant, there is the opportunity to view wildlife along these routes.

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill.

Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area.

Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it.

Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Note that this stretch of the trail is prime snake terrain, so be cautious. At about 0.3 mile the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a small loop. We went left. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.But as the trail climbs, the scenery just gets better. Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia. Elsewhere, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow aster-like beauties, and microsensis painted the terrain. And oh! the bitterroot—when the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink.The memorial site (which can be seen from all along the trail) offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley as well as the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 101 (Thorp) and after exiting, turn right.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail. Switchback down hillsides and through lush green forest, until you arrive at the beautiful falls and the Big Bridge.","driving_directions":"To reach the main trailhead, drive east on I-90 to exit 34 (about 31 miles from Seattle).

It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These “cave holes” were formed when miner’s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. After a short set of stairs going down it’s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it’s heavily used and fills up quickly.

Within minutes you can leave city life behind and be immersed in picture-perfect scenery accompanied by the sound of birds. The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.  At 2.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction near a softball sports complex. This makes a good turnaround point unless you would like to use the restrooms on the east side of the fields.WTA Pro Tip: If you’d like a more wheelchair friendly walk, you can access the Salmon Creek Trail from Salmon Creek Park or the softball field parking lot, both off NE 117th Street.","driving_directions":"The trailhead is in Vancouver Washington, located in on NW 36th Avenue between the Felida Bridge and NW 138th Street.

Though they've scaled many an international peak, many of them practiced their chops on this fairly diminutive, but close-to-town leg-burner. There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath. For those who are interested and have a good map there are numerous alternative trails that return to I-90 and exit 20.

The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

As hikers, we get to see their efforts up close. Snow Mountain Ranch offers a variety of summer and winter walks on 9.2 miles of trails. Relics of the old cattle ranch still remind hikers of the past on this 1,800-acre property. The ranch was home to Elon and Joan Gilbert, friends of Justice William O. Douglas, whom he would often stop to visit on his way into the Cascades from his home in Yakima. History is just one of many attractions at Snow Mountain Ranch. Hike the riparian areas for a chance to glimpse great horned owls, or focus your binoculars on the local pond for sightings of a variety of ducks. The lowland fields provide excellent hunting grounds for red-tailed hawks, sharp shinned hawks and northern harriers. There is also a resident population of elk that wander in and out of ranch area. Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail. This trail climbs 1 mile south along the benchlands above the ravine to a junction with the Bench Loop Trail and a connection with the west leg of the Cowiche Mountain Loop Trail. Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch. Once on the summit, kick back, bask in the sun and enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.

The 25-foot falls are the final waterfall along Cherry Creek. The falls drop over a wide, rocky ledge into a large pool. This pool is inviting to hikers, but as always with waterfalls, be careful when splashing and playing in rocky areas. Cherry Creek flows well all year long, but by autumn the left-hand side of the falls usually dries up.To find the unmarked trail head entrance, look directly behind the road sign marking the junction of Kelly Road and Moutain View Road.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north. You will pass a fast food restaurant and a service station. If you have any thoughts of using a restroom these will be your only options until you get back to town. There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries!

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades.

From the boat landing, hikers and campers pile onto a bus that climbs up steep switchbacks (hang on and close your eyes) to Holden Village, a Lutheran summer camp. The scene is a bit surreal for backpackers, but the summer campers are obviously having a great time.From Holden Village start hiking along dirt road past the ruins of the old mining town. After a mile there is the Holden camping area and you enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Here the road becomes a trail through a rather uniform forest. Bugs can be severe in mid-summer. After another 3.9 miles of gently ascending, well maintained trail you reach Hart Lake. There is no convenient camping between the Holden camp and Hart Lake. There is pleasant camping at the west end of cool, deep Hart Lake.The trail sticks to the valley floor for the next mile with several high waterfalls in view. There is reasonable camping at Rebel Camp. The trail then gradually switchbacks up the North side of the valley. This section of trail is quite brushy and dusty, but has nice views of Hart Lake, and blueberries in season.Shallow, emerald green Lower Lyman Lake comes into view 3.2 miles beyond Rebel Camp.

It was relocated in the early 2000s and is a popular WTA volunteer work party site to this day. The route now goes through a notch easily spied from Highway 101 in the Quilcene Range, climbing steeply to the notch and then traversing the hillside.From the parking area off Forest Road 10, set off up a rugged, narrow, but easy to follow trail. You'll climb steeply through classic Olympic forest, surrounded by red cedar and hemlock trees cloaked in moss. The switchbacks are constant, and there's not much for views on your way to the pass, but look closely at your surroundings and you'll be surprised at how many varieties of moss spring to life on the forest floor. The trail climbs steadily the whole way to Notch Pass - you'll gain 2000 feet of elevation in 2.1 miles.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These “cave holes” were formed when miner’s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. After a short set of stairs going down it’s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it’s heavily used and fills up quickly.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Note that this stretch of the trail is prime snake terrain, so be cautious. At about 0.3 mile the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a small loop. We went left. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.But as the trail climbs, the scenery just gets better. Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia. Elsewhere, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow aster-like beauties, and microsensis painted the terrain. And oh! the bitterroot—when the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink.The memorial site (which can be seen from all along the trail) offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley as well as the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 101 (Thorp) and after exiting, turn right.

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive I-90 to exit 32. Turn left onto 436th Ave SE. Follow 436th to its end at SE North Bend Way. Turn left.

The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north. You will pass a fast food restaurant and a service station. If you have any thoughts of using a restroom these will be your only options until you get back to town. There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries! The sign for the left branch adds \"Next 24 Miles,\" and that's your route.The pavement soon ends, and you will have a 20-mile drive on rough roads that often have potholes and may be dusty. Take your time and accept the situation. The route isn't very scenic: you'll just be passing a lot of logged-over areas. About 17 miles from the Y, turn left and cross a bridge over Lennox Creek. Then turn right onto Forest Road 57, where the \"57\" sometimes is obscured by vegetation. (Remember this intersection for your return when you will go left here, cross the bridge, then go right onto North Fork Road.)On Road 57, it's another 3.2 miles to the Bare Mountain Trailhead. It will be on your left at an elevation of 2,100 feet. Parking is available in a wide area on the right side of the road or along the shoulder. There is room for perhaps six or seven cars, plus two more on the left at the trailhead itself. There are no facilities here. Display your Northwest Forest Pass in your car. Then fill out one of the Wilderness Use Permit forms available at the trailhead and deposit the bottom half in the box. These forms are used to estimate trail usage and that, in turn, impacts funding for trail maintenance. So it is important.","distance":"8.6 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.6395","longitude":"-121.5283","elevation_gain":"3300","highest_point":"5353"},{"features":"undefinedMountain views","region_image":"https://www.wta.org/central_washington.png","google_map":"www.google.com/maps/dir//46.6593,-120.7556/@46.6593,-120.7556,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/wildflowers-mt-cleman-wildflower-trail-snow-mtn-ranch-photo-c-david-hagen.jpg/@@images/3ef191ea-7aba-4d9c-8d6e-b5e1322b1449.jpeg","region":"Central Washington","current_rating":"3.00 out of 5","name":"Snow Mountain Ranch","trail_description":"Cowiche Canyon Conservancy hopes to re-invigorate native shrub-steppe habitat to the once working cattle operation at Snow Mountain Ranch, a scant nine miles west of Yakima. As hikers, we get to see their efforts up close. Snow Mountain Ranch offers a variety of summer and winter walks on 9.2 miles of trails. Relics of the old cattle ranch still remind hikers of the past on this 1,800-acre property. The ranch was home to Elon and Joan Gilbert, friends of Justice William O. Douglas, whom he would often stop to visit on his way into the Cascades from his home in Yakima. History is just one of many attractions at Snow Mountain Ranch. Hike the riparian areas for a chance to glimpse great horned owls, or focus your binoculars on the local pond for sightings of a variety of ducks. The lowland fields provide excellent hunting grounds for red-tailed hawks, sharp shinned hawks and northern harriers. There is also a resident population of elk that wander in and out of ranch area. Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail. This trail climbs 1 mile south along the benchlands above the ravine to a junction with the Bench Loop Trail and a connection with the west leg of the Cowiche Mountain Loop Trail. Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch. Once on the summit, kick back, bask in the sun and enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.

From the boat landing, hikers and campers pile onto a bus that climbs up steep switchbacks (hang on and close your eyes) to Holden Village, a Lutheran summer camp. The scene is a bit surreal for backpackers, but the summer campers are obviously having a great time.From Holden Village start hiking along dirt road past the ruins of the old mining town. After a mile there is the Holden camping area and you enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Here the road becomes a trail through a rather uniform forest. Bugs can be severe in mid-summer. After another 3.9 miles of gently ascending, well maintained trail you reach Hart Lake. There is no convenient camping between the Holden camp and Hart Lake. There is pleasant camping at the west end of cool, deep Hart Lake.The trail sticks to the valley floor for the next mile with several high waterfalls in view. There is reasonable camping at Rebel Camp. The trail then gradually switchbacks up the North side of the valley. This section of trail is quite brushy and dusty, but has nice views of Hart Lake, and blueberries in season.Shallow, emerald green Lower Lyman Lake comes into view 3.2 miles beyond Rebel Camp. The more scenic campsites are on the west side of the camping area. Continue around the lake, up and up to Upper Lyman Lakes, icy and blue under Chiwawa Mountain and the Lyman Glacier, with views up to Spider Gap. Scramblers can pass through the gap to Spider Meadows.Another option from Lower Lyman is to hike 1.5 miles to Cloudy Pass for flower-strewn meadows and great views, including Sitting Bull Mountain and Needle Peak.

In order for hikers to continue to enjoy access privileges, please remain on main path, observe leash laws and keep noise to a minimum as a courtesy to home-owners along trail.Originally the site of a logging camp in the first part of the 20th century, Cherry Creek Falls is now a popular place for locals (and visitors) to cool off after the hike in. The 25-foot falls are the final waterfall along Cherry Creek. The falls drop over a wide, rocky ledge into a large pool. This pool is inviting to hikers, but as always with waterfalls, be careful when splashing and playing in rocky areas. Cherry Creek flows well all year long, but by autumn the left-hand side of the falls usually dries up.To find the unmarked trail head entrance, look directly behind the road sign marking the junction of Kelly Road and Moutain View Road. This is the unmarked trailhead entrance, near a locked blue gate.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW.

Though they've scaled many an international peak, many of them practiced their chops on this fairly diminutive, but close-to-town leg-burner. There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath. For those who are interested and have a good map there are numerous alternative trails that return to I-90 and exit 20. For the patient and observant, there is the opportunity to view wildlife along these routes. This author has personally seen owls, deer, and a bear.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, take I-90 east to exit 20 for High Point Way.

The route now goes through a notch easily spied from Highway 101 in the Quilcene Range, climbing steeply to the notch and then traversing the hillside.From the parking area off Forest Road 10, set off up a rugged, narrow, but easy to follow trail. You'll climb steeply through classic Olympic forest, surrounded by red cedar and hemlock trees cloaked in moss.

For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows.

Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail.

A bridge here used to cross Spinola Creek before heading back to Waptus Lake, but a flood took the bridge out, and now hikers use the nearby Horse Ford, which is accessed from Waptus Pass Trail. After crossing the river, the trail continues straight on to Waptus Lake. Here it rejoins the Waptus River Trail, proceeding around the lake for a mile and a half, at which point it turns away from the lake and heads uphill for another half mile to a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail.","driving_directions":"Drive I-90 to exit 80, Rosyln/Salmon La Sac.

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive I-90 to exit 32. Turn left onto 436th Ave SE. Follow 436th to its end at SE North Bend Way. Turn left.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north. You will pass a fast food restaurant and a service station. If you have any thoughts of using a restroom these will be your only options until you get back to town. There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries! The sign for the left branch adds \"Next 24 Miles,\" and that's your route.The pavement soon ends, and you will have a 20-mile drive on rough roads that often have potholes and may be dusty. Take your time and accept the situation. The route isn't very scenic: you'll just be passing a lot of logged-over areas. About 17 miles from the Y, turn left and cross a bridge over Lennox Creek. Then turn right onto Forest Road 57, where the \"57\" sometimes is obscured by vegetation. (Remember this intersection for your return when you will go left here, cross the bridge, then go right onto North Fork Road.)On Road 57, it's another 3.2 miles to the Bare Mountain Trailhead. It will be on your left at an elevation of 2,100 feet. Parking is available in a wide area on the right side of the road or along the shoulder. There is room for perhaps six or seven cars, plus two more on the left at the trailhead itself. There are no facilities here. Display your Northwest Forest Pass in your car. Then fill out one of the Wilderness Use Permit forms available at the trailhead and deposit the bottom half in the box. These forms are used to estimate trail usage and that, in turn, impacts funding for trail maintenance.

The scene is a bit surreal for backpackers, but the summer campers are obviously having a great time.From Holden Village start hiking along dirt road past the ruins of the old mining town. After a mile there is the Holden camping area and you enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Here the road becomes a trail through a rather uniform forest. Bugs can be severe in mid-summer.

As hikers, we get to see their efforts up close. Snow Mountain Ranch offers a variety of summer and winter walks on 9.2 miles of trails. Relics of the old cattle ranch still remind hikers of the past on this 1,800-acre property. The ranch was home to Elon and Joan Gilbert, friends of Justice William O. Douglas, whom he would often stop to visit on his way into the Cascades from his home in Yakima. History is just one of many attractions at Snow Mountain Ranch. Hike the riparian areas for a chance to glimpse great horned owls, or focus your binoculars on the local pond for sightings of a variety of ducks. The lowland fields provide excellent hunting grounds for red-tailed hawks, sharp shinned hawks and northern harriers. There is also a resident population of elk that wander in and out of ranch area. Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail.

But the lakes aren't the only attraction - you will encounter meadows, old-growth and views of towering mountains.This trail is not for the beginning backpacker. There is considerable elevation gain and loss -- about 16,000 feet! Some places are impassable until well into August when the snow melts out. And the distance requires hikers to carry six or seven days of food and arrange for a car shuttle or pick-up at Stevens Pass.

It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These “cave holes” were formed when miner’s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. After a short set of stairs going down it’s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it’s heavily used and fills up quickly. The trailhead is equipped with two privies, garbage cans, a picnic table, historical interpretive signage, and doggie bag dispenser.","driving_directions":"From Seattle head east on I-90.

A short bridge designed to be removed when the creek runs high begins the route. After climbing quickly through a switchback and series of climbing turns the trail winds more gently to Ridell Lake (which is better described as a wetland on its way to becoming a meadow).Curving around the wetland hikers get a nice view of the Rock before heading into the trees again for another climb to Hwy 14 where the route ends opposite the park headquarters. To reach the start of the Beacon Rock Trail, turn left to head east for 100 yards.The main purpose for the trail is to provide a safe passage for visitors who arrive by boat and wish to hike the Rock. But It is also a great way to extend a visit to the park by combining a picnic at Doetsch Ranch picnic area with a hike up to the Rock and back.If you forgot to bring a lunch, the Beacon Rock Cafe nestled in the Skamania General Store has excellent burgers, breakfasts and is a surprising find for those who don't expect much from a roadside general store.

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 85 for East Cle Elum.

The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW.

Now, it provides skiers and snowshoers a place to warm up after a bracing 4.5 mile jaunt along forest roads in Tahoma State Forest. Access to the south district of the huts, managed by Mount Tahoma Trails Association, is via a series of steep forest roads. Climbing almost the entire way, the trek can be tiring, but don’t let this discourage you. The views are well worth it.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully.

Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia.

However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath.

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930’s and then as a ski area until the 1970’s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -– a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier. Bring a GPS device or download compass bearings from the park website as a backup. Such contingencies show that the dividing line between day-hiking and alpine conditions is blurred here, yet another way this hike takes you into truly rarefied air, more than halfway up the tallest peak in Washington.","driving_directions":"From the west, drive Highway 706 (National Park Highway) to the Nisqually Entrance to Mount Rainier National Park.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath.

Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail. This trail climbs 1 mile south along the benchlands above the ravine to a junction with the Bench Loop Trail and a connection with the west leg of the Cowiche Mountain Loop Trail. Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch. Once on the summit, kick back, bask in the sun and enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. When it’s time to return, descend the way you came or make it a loop by descending on the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail.","driving_directions":"From SR 12 on the north side of Yakima, exit at 40th Avenue and proceed 1.5 miles south to Summitview Avenue.

The scene is a bit surreal for backpackers, but the summer campers are obviously having a great time.From Holden Village start hiking along dirt road past the ruins of the old mining town. After a mile there is the Holden camping area and you enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Here the road becomes a trail through a rather uniform forest. Bugs can be severe in mid-summer. After another 3.9 miles of gently ascending, well maintained trail you reach Hart Lake. There is no convenient camping between the Holden camp and Hart Lake. There is pleasant camping at the west end of cool, deep Hart Lake.The trail sticks to the valley floor for the next mile with several high waterfalls in view. There is reasonable camping at Rebel Camp. The trail then gradually switchbacks up the North side of the valley. This section of trail is quite brushy and dusty, but has nice views of Hart Lake, and blueberries in season.Shallow, emerald green Lower Lyman Lake comes into view 3.2 miles beyond Rebel Camp. The more scenic campsites are on the west side of the camping area.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Note that this stretch of the trail is prime snake terrain, so be cautious. At about 0.3 mile the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a small loop. We went left. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.But as the trail climbs, the scenery just gets better. Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia. Elsewhere, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow aster-like beauties, and microsensis painted the terrain. And oh! the bitterroot—when the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink.The memorial site (which can be seen from all along the trail) offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley as well as the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 101 (Thorp) and after exiting, turn right.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW.

In order for hikers to continue to enjoy access privileges, please remain on main path, observe leash laws and keep noise to a minimum as a courtesy to home-owners along trail.Originally the site of a logging camp in the first part of the 20th century, Cherry Creek Falls is now a popular place for locals (and visitors) to cool off after the hike in. The 25-foot falls are the final waterfall along Cherry Creek. The falls drop over a wide, rocky ledge into a large pool. This pool is inviting to hikers, but as always with waterfalls, be careful when splashing and playing in rocky areas. Cherry Creek flows well all year long, but by autumn the left-hand side of the falls usually dries up.To find the unmarked trail head entrance, look directly behind the road sign marking the junction of Kelly Road and Moutain View Road.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north. You will pass a fast food restaurant and a service station. If you have any thoughts of using a restroom these will be your only options until you get back to town. There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries! The sign for the left branch adds \"Next 24 Miles,\" and that's your route.The pavement soon ends, and you will have a 20-mile drive on rough roads that often have potholes and may be dusty. Take your time and accept the situation. The route isn't very scenic: you'll just be passing a lot of logged-over areas. About 17 miles from the Y, turn left and cross a bridge over Lennox Creek. Then turn right onto Forest Road 57, where the \"57\" sometimes is obscured by vegetation. (Remember this intersection for your return when you will go left here, cross the bridge, then go right onto North Fork Road.)On Road 57, it's another 3.2 miles to the Bare Mountain Trailhead. It will be on your left at an elevation of 2,100 feet. Parking is available in a wide area on the right side of the road or along the shoulder. There is room for perhaps six or seven cars, plus two more on the left at the trailhead itself. There are no facilities here. Display your Northwest Forest Pass in your car. Then fill out one of the Wilderness Use Permit forms available at the trailhead and deposit the bottom half in the box. These forms are used to estimate trail usage and that, in turn, impacts funding for trail maintenance.

The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail.

Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 85 for East Cle Elum.

Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track.

It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These “cave holes” were formed when miner’s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. After a short set of stairs going down it’s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it’s heavily used and fills up quickly. The trailhead is equipped with two privies, garbage cans, a picnic table, historical interpretive signage, and doggie bag dispenser.","driving_directions":"From Seattle head east on I-90.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

Though they've scaled many an international peak, many of them practiced their chops on this fairly diminutive, but close-to-town leg-burner. There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath. For those who are interested and have a good map there are numerous alternative trails that return to I-90 and exit 20.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW.

Relics of the old cattle ranch still remind hikers of the past on this 1,800-acre property. The ranch was home to Elon and Joan Gilbert, friends of Justice William O. Douglas, whom he would often stop to visit on his way into the Cascades from his home in Yakima. History is just one of many attractions at Snow Mountain Ranch. Hike the riparian areas for a chance to glimpse great horned owls, or focus your binoculars on the local pond for sightings of a variety of ducks. The lowland fields provide excellent hunting grounds for red-tailed hawks, sharp shinned hawks and northern harriers. There is also a resident population of elk that wander in and out of ranch area. Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map.

Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Note that this stretch of the trail is prime snake terrain, so be cautious. At about 0.3 mile the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a small loop. We went left. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.But as the trail climbs, the scenery just gets better. Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia. Elsewhere, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow aster-like beauties, and microsensis painted the terrain. And oh! the bitterroot—when the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink.The memorial site (which can be seen from all along the trail) offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley as well as the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 101 (Thorp) and after exiting, turn right.

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930’s and then as a ski area until the 1970’s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -– a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier. Bring a GPS device or download compass bearings from the park website as a backup. Such contingencies show that the dividing line between day-hiking and alpine conditions is blurred here, yet another way this hike takes you into truly rarefied air, more than halfway up the tallest peak in Washington.","driving_directions":"From the west, drive Highway 706 (National Park Highway) to the Nisqually Entrance to Mount Rainier National Park.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail.

The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 85 for East Cle Elum.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north.

There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries! The sign for the left branch adds \"Next 24 Miles,\" and that's your route.The pavement soon ends, and you will have a 20-mile drive on rough roads that often have potholes and may be dusty. Take your time and accept the situation. The route isn't very scenic: you'll just be passing a lot of logged-over areas. About 17 miles from the Y, turn left and cross a bridge over Lennox Creek. Then turn right onto Forest Road 57, where the \"57\" sometimes is obscured by vegetation. (Remember this intersection for your return when you will go left here, cross the bridge, then go right onto North Fork Road.)On Road 57, it's another 3.2 miles to the Bare Mountain Trailhead.

It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These “cave holes” were formed when miner’s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. After a short set of stairs going down it’s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it’s heavily used and fills up quickly.

The scene is a bit surreal for backpackers, but the summer campers are obviously having a great time.From Holden Village start hiking along dirt road past the ruins of the old mining town. After a mile there is the Holden camping area and you enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Here the road becomes a trail through a rather uniform forest. Bugs can be severe in mid-summer. After another 3.9 miles of gently ascending, well maintained trail you reach Hart Lake. There is no convenient camping between the Holden camp and Hart Lake. There is pleasant camping at the west end of cool, deep Hart Lake.The trail sticks to the valley floor for the next mile with several high waterfalls in view. There is reasonable camping at Rebel Camp. The trail then gradually switchbacks up the North side of the valley. This section of trail is quite brushy and dusty, but has nice views of Hart Lake, and blueberries in season.Shallow, emerald green Lower Lyman Lake comes into view 3.2 miles beyond Rebel Camp. The more scenic campsites are on the west side of the camping area. Continue around the lake, up and up to Upper Lyman Lakes, icy and blue under Chiwawa Mountain and the Lyman Glacier, with views up to Spider Gap. Scramblers can pass through the gap to Spider Meadows.Another option from Lower Lyman is to hike 1.5 miles to Cloudy Pass for flower-strewn meadows and great views, including Sitting Bull Mountain and Needle Peak.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as \"Twin Falls.\") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail. Switchback down hillsides and through lush green forest, until you arrive at the beautiful falls and the Big Bridge.","driving_directions":"To reach the main trailhead, drive east on I-90 to exit 34 (about 31 miles from Seattle).

Backpackers who complete the Snoqualmie - Stevens segment of the Pacific Crest Trail will hike through some of the most remote and diverse mountain country along the entire 2650-mile trail. The route traverses the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and the trail passes by a least a dozen lakes along the way, many of them swimmable in late-summer. But the lakes aren't the only attraction - you will encounter meadows, old-growth and views of towering mountains.This trail is not for the beginning backpacker. There is considerable elevation gain and loss -- about 16,000 feet! Some places are impassable until well into August when the snow melts out. And the distance requires hikers to carry six or seven days of food and arrange for a car shuttle or pick-up at Stevens Pass.

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930’s and then as a ski area until the 1970’s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -– a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier. Bring a GPS device or download compass bearings from the park website as a backup. Such contingencies show that the dividing line between day-hiking and alpine conditions is blurred here, yet another way this hike takes you into truly rarefied air, more than halfway up the tallest peak in Washington.","driving_directions":"From the west, drive Highway 706 (National Park Highway) to the Nisqually Entrance to Mount Rainier National Park. Follow Paradise Road East approximately 17.5 miles to Paradise. From the east, take Highway 123 to Stevens Canyon Road (Note that this road is closed in the winter). 19 miles from the turnoff, turn right onto Paradise Road East.

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are \"Bear,\" while the mountain is \"Bare.\") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues.","driving_directions":"From I-90 about 30 miles east of Seattle, take Exit 31 (North Bend) and head north. You will pass a fast food restaurant and a service station. If you have any thoughts of using a restroom these will be your only options until you get back to town. There are no facilities along North Fork Road, or at the trailhead. Cross the railroad tracks and turn right on North Bend Way, go two blocks, then turn left onto Ballarat Ave. Stay on that main road as it changes directions (and names) several times. In about four miles, come to a Y where both branches are marked \"Dead End.\" No worries!

Take your time and accept the situation. The route isn't very scenic: you'll just be passing a lot of logged-over areas. About 17 miles from the Y, turn left and cross a bridge over Lennox Creek. Then turn right onto Forest Road 57, where the \"57\" sometimes is obscured by vegetation.

Then fill out one of the Wilderness Use Permit forms available at the trailhead and deposit the bottom half in the box. These forms are used to estimate trail usage and that, in turn, impacts funding for trail maintenance.

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, head east on I-90 to exit 85 for East Cle Elum.

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, drive I-90 to exit 32. Turn left onto 436th Ave SE. Follow 436th to its end at SE North Bend Way. Turn left.

As hikers, we get to see their efforts up close. Snow Mountain Ranch offers a variety of summer and winter walks on 9.2 miles of trails. Relics of the old cattle ranch still remind hikers of the past on this 1,800-acre property. The ranch was home to Elon and Joan Gilbert, friends of Justice William O. Douglas, whom he would often stop to visit on his way into the Cascades from his home in Yakima. History is just one of many attractions at Snow Mountain Ranch. Hike the riparian areas for a chance to glimpse great horned owls, or focus your binoculars on the local pond for sightings of a variety of ducks. The lowland fields provide excellent hunting grounds for red-tailed hawks, sharp shinned hawks and northern harriers. There is also a resident population of elk that wander in and out of ranch area. Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail. This trail climbs 1 mile south along the benchlands above the ravine to a junction with the Bench Loop Trail and a connection with the west leg of the Cowiche Mountain Loop Trail. Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch.

Now, it provides skiers and snowshoers a place to warm up after a bracing 4.5 mile jaunt along forest roads in Tahoma State Forest. Access to the south district of the huts, managed by Mount Tahoma Trails Association, is via a series of steep forest roads. Climbing almost the entire way, the trek can be tiring, but don’t let this discourage you. The views are well worth it. If you're snowshoeing, make sure to practice good trail manners and stay to the right side of the road, out of the ski tracks.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.","driving_directions":"To reach the trailhead, turn onto Icicle Creek Road from US2 on the very western edge of Leavenworth.

From the boat landing, hikers and campers pile onto a bus that climbs up steep switchbacks (hang on and close your eyes) to Holden Village, a Lutheran summer camp. The scene is a bit surreal for backpackers, but the summer campers are obviously having a great time.From Holden Village start hiking along dirt road past the ruins of the old mining town. After a mile there is the Holden camping area and you enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Here the road becomes a trail through a rather uniform forest. Bugs can be severe in mid-summer. After another 3.9 miles of gently ascending, well maintained trail you reach Hart Lake. There is no convenient camping between the Holden camp and Hart Lake. There is pleasant camping at the west end of cool, deep Hart Lake.The trail sticks to the valley floor for the next mile with several high waterfalls in view. There is reasonable camping at Rebel Camp. The trail then gradually switchbacks up the North side of the valley. This section of trail is quite brushy and dusty, but has nice views of Hart Lake, and blueberries in season.Shallow, emerald green Lower Lyman Lake comes into view 3.2 miles beyond Rebel Camp. The more scenic campsites are on the west side of the camping area. Continue around the lake, up and up to Upper Lyman Lakes, icy and blue under Chiwawa Mountain and the Lyman Glacier, with views up to Spider Gap. Scramblers can pass through the gap to Spider Meadows.Another option from Lower Lyman is to hike 1.5 miles to Cloudy Pass for flower-strewn meadows and great views, including Sitting Bull Mountain and Needle Peak. A knoll Southwest of Cloudy Pass has an unobstructed view of nearby Glacier Peak. Just below the pass is a gentle mountain stream and established campsite.","driving_directions":"From Highway 2 turn onto 97N and drive to the town of Chelan, where you will see the sign for the Lady of the Lake Boat Company.

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the \"flavor\" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.","driving_directions":"The Eddie McAbee park entrance is on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW.

It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These “cave holes” were formed when miner’s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. After a short set of stairs going down it’s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it’s heavily used and fills up quickly.

Here it rejoins the Waptus River Trail, proceeding around the lake for a mile and a half, at which point it turns away from the lake and heads uphill for another half mile to a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail.","driving_directions":"Drive I-90 to exit 80, Rosyln/Salmon La Sac.

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn’t heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds—birds on the ground and in the air. You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis’s woodpeckers pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever present red-tailed hawks. And if birds aren’t enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in the late spring. Deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views—especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Note that this stretch of the trail is prime snake terrain, so be cautious. At about 0.3 mile the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a small loop. We went left. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.But as the trail climbs, the scenery just gets better. Birds keep you company along the entire trek, but there are also amazing flower displays all around. Areas of the open slope were blue with brodacia. Elsewhere, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow aster-like beauties, and microsensis painted the terrain. And oh! the bitterroot—when the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink.The memorial site (which can be seen from all along the trail) offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley as well as the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene.","driving_directions":"From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 101 (Thorp) and after exiting, turn right.

In order for hikers to continue to enjoy access privileges, please remain on main path, observe leash laws and keep noise to a minimum as a courtesy to home-owners along trail.Originally the site of a logging camp in the first part of the 20th century, Cherry Creek Falls is now a popular place for locals (and visitors) to cool off after the hike in. The 25-foot falls are the final waterfall along Cherry Creek. The falls drop over a wide, rocky ledge into a large pool. This pool is inviting to hikers, but as always with waterfalls, be careful when splashing and playing in rocky areas. Cherry Creek flows well all year long, but by autumn the left-hand side of the falls usually dries up.To find the unmarked trail head entrance, look directly behind the road sign marking the junction of Kelly Road and Moutain View Road. This is the unmarked trailhead entrance, near a locked blue gate. Note that parking is limited to the shoulder of Mountain View Road only, there is no trail access near road signs marked Private or No Parking. From where you park, follow the road-turned-trail behind the gate and the corresponding junctions as follows. At three-quarters of a mile you’ll cross Margaret Creek on a bridge. Shortly after that, stay left at the first junction and right at the second, ignoring any grassy overgrown roads.After climbing a short hill, stay right at the third junction and proceed downhill. At 1.5 miles, the road makes a sharp hairpin to the right. Head left on a muddy track through the woods. Stay left at next junction to then rejoin the overgrown road. Taking a right at this junction leads you past a crashed car in the trees. Stay straight for another mile, hopping across a few creeks then arrive at Hannan Creek, a large washout that has been leveled by machinery. Ford the creek--walking sticks left by other hikers can be of assistance here. The trail to the falls branches off to the right on the other side of Hannan Creek. It may be hidden from view by a large dirt pile. Follow the sound of the falls, and shortly a firepit area is reached, which overlooks the falls. There is a short path leading to the base of the falls, a total of two and a half miles from the trailhead.","driving_directions":"From the junction of SR 203 and Woodinville-Duvall Road in downtown Duvall, head north on SR 203 for about 500 feet, then turn right on NE Cherry Valley Road.

Though they've scaled many an international peak, many of them practiced their chops on this fairly diminutive, but close-to-town leg-burner. There are many trails which start or finish around I-90’s “High Point Way” exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area. It isn’t particularly hard but it isn’t easy either as it winds steadily uphill on old logging roads through a rejuvenating forest.When starting this hike from either the road or from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) parking lot one should be careful, as there are several trails heading off in different directions. However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it’s close proximity to the city.The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill’s steepest grade. The summit of Tiger-3 isn’t fancy, but it provides enough space to have a meal or catch your breath. For those who are interested and have a good map there are numerous alternative trails that return to I-90 and exit 20. For the patient and observant, there is the opportunity to view wildlife along these routes. This author has personally seen owls, deer, and a bear.","driving_directions":"From Seattle, take I-90 east to exit 20 for High Point Way. At the bottom of the exit ramp, turn right at the stop sign and then immediately turn right again. You will now be traveling west, paralleling I-90 on your right. Park along this road if you can find a spot--it's popular here because no permit is required. If you can't find a spot on the road, or you've found a spot and you're read to start hiking, travel another half mile or so through a gate and along a rough road, before coming to the official DNR parking lot where a Discover Pass is required. Water, maps, and toilets are also available here. Be aware that the gate closes to this lot at night.","distance":"5.0 miles, roundtrip","latitude":"47.5296","longitude":"-121.9956","elevation_gain":"2100","highest_point":"2525"},{"features":"Wildlife","region_image":"https://www.wta.org/southwest_washington.png","google_map":"www.google.com/maps/dir//45.6790,-122.7429/@45.6790,-122.7429,11z/data=?hl=en","thumbnail":"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/img_3467.jpg/@@images/e6779eed-9717-4e28-ad13-ed7372e62dbb.jpeg","region":"Southwest Washington","current_rating":"0.00 out of 5","name":"Vancouver Lake - North Trail","trail_description":"A gentle meandering barrier-free path leads through a mature cottonwood forest just west of Vancouver Lake. Although you can't see the lake through all the trees, there are other sights and sounds to enjoy along this route. Most notably the vibrant greens of the understory in spring, beautiful fall yellows and quite a few species of birds nearly all year.To reach the trail from Vancouver Lake Regional Park, walk north past the large group picnic areas on a gravel road. The road enters the forest and continues for about 700 feet before turning west. Find the footpath right at this bend in the road.From there it is about one mile through the forest before the trail ends at a dirt \"road\". A new bridge to the west crosses Buckmire Slough providing foot and bicycle access to the 501 spur near its dead end.The entire length of this trail was built by volunteers from Washington Trails Association and Clark County. Construction was completed on February 18th, 2016. You can also take the nearby Frenchman's Bar trail from the parking lot across the way to Frenchman's Bar Regional Park. The wide, paved path provides the perfect urban getaway for hikers and dog walkers alike—it’s also a favorite among birders. On clear days, you’ll be treated to views of Mount Hood, Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens.As the trail proceeds past Vancouver Lake to Frenchman’s Bar Regional Park, it traverses the shore of the Columbia River, with views across the way to Sauvie Island and the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, just north of Kelly Point Park. With unhindered views of the Columbia River, open sandy beaches and mountain vistas, there’s plenty of room to stretch out in this southwest Washington backyard.While dogs are permitted on the trail year-round, they are not permitted on the beach or surrounding turf area of Vancouver Lake Regional Park between April 1 and Oct. 31.WTA volunteers completed construction of this trail in spring of 2016. The project was the culmination of several years of planning and multiple years of construction with partners including the Chinook Trail Association, AmeriCorps volunteers from the National Civilian Community Corps. The County helped to pay for construction materials with funds the Parks Foundation of Clark County through a grant sponsored by the Dorothy Langsdorf Trail Fund and the Langsdorf Family.","driving_directions":"Vancouver Lake is just west of Vancouver.

This paved trail takes you through wetlands, around ponds, and across a natural habitat undergoing restoration. Within minutes you can leave city life behind and be immersed in picture-perfect scenery accompanied by the sound of birds. The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.  At 2.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction near a softball sports complex. This makes a good turnaround point unless you would like to use the restrooms on the east side of the fields.WTA Pro Tip: If you’d like a more wheelchair friendly walk, you can access the Salmon Creek Trail from Salmon Creek Park or the softball field parking lot, both off NE 117th Street.","driving_directions":"The trailhead is in Vancouver Washington, located in on NW 36th Avenue between the Felida Bridge and NW 138th Street.
